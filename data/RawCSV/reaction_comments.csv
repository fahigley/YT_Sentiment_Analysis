1,so the lead singer is freddy mercury  i would recomend watching teh film with the same name as it explains his life pretty well
2,“What the fuck is going on?!!”
3,"Beats the hell out of rap , doesn&#39;t it?"
4,"This song is just as ... unique ... today as when it came out in 1975. The week it broke into the top 40, #1 was Paul Simon&#39;s &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot;, and just a few weeks before it had been Barry Manilow&#39;s &quot;I Write the Songs.&quot;  There was literally nothing even approximately like this on the charts, and I can&#39;t think of anything like it since."
5,"This is absolutely the best reaction to this song!  They went from christmas morning to halloween real quick!  I dont know if i want to call my mama or throw the phone at her!  Bro, what in the hell!?  Just a couple things you said that made me lol"
6,Queen is so iconic and this reaction is why
7,U just went up a peg in my book Shaq

11,Genuinely reacting
12,Your reactions are off tha hook
13,"You should review the song Warrior, by Pat Benatar. An Awesome song from the &#39;80&#39;s. The lead singer for Queen was Freddie Mercury."
14,This is a self - tribute song to the fact he was dying of aids !   Now listen to it …it all<br>Makes sense
15,Its like they played 4 seperate bangers back to back.

46,"Great reactions! “These guys go from Christmas to Halloween real quick!” 😁 Freddy Mercury is Persian Indian raised in India, Africa and later moved to UK. I reckon that huge cultural mix plus genius is the reason he took that band beyond the clouds. He broke barriers of consciousness. Beautiful."
47,❤😂😮 that makes you feel I filled it lol and they say queen was gay lol
48,Pls look up Queen Live aid 1985
49,You need to watch the film ‘bohemian rhapsody’ it’s a film about his life (not a documentary) it’s insane

63,Still the best bohemian Rhapsody reaction ever !!!!
64,Freddy Mercury was a musical genius.  Only he could mix operatic music with rock and make something that has lasted generations.  Watch his Live Aid performance...he worked the audience like a master potter molds clay.  He was the king of crowd control and live performances. Gone too soon from this world.

74,My fav Queen song 🙌🏼 def takes you on a journey 😂❤
75,“WTF IS GOING ON?” 😂😂 😂😂  Best YouTube reaction in the history of EVER. 😂😂😂😂  This came out when I was in high school. We immediately liked it because it meant an 8-minute slow dance with our favorite girl. Later in college as a DJ it meant I could go to the bathroom. 🤣🤣🤣
76,This. In my opinion to most perfect song in all of history. Just pure art.
77,I remember believing in this &quot;reaction&quot; a few years ago...
78,Who is this singer??????
79,Listen to &#39;Interstellar Overdrive&#39; by Pink Floyd on headphones.
80,That&#39;s exactly how it&#39;s supposed to make u feel
81,"Opera meets rock! Freddie was a genius, never got bored of this after being number 1 for 9 weeks in the UK (first time round that is) still listening to it almost half a century later. You face is a picture in this reaction😁"
82,This song is supernatural
83,Freddie Mercury  so sad such a genius  left us too soon.

89,“What the fuck is going on?” summarizes this song perfectly.
90,Man’s single handedly carrying the music community

116,"I’m 37 years old now. My parents have always loved music and they were major hippies and rockers. They love old school rap music too. They’re cool as hell. The speakers are the first thing replaced in all their new cars. That shit is always loud as hell! 😅😂 Anyway, I was in kindergarten the first time I really remember hearing this song although I know they played it even when I was in the womb. It was the first song I ever heard that gave me goosebumps. Doesn’t get any better!"
117,By far the greatest reaction I&#39;ve ever seen on this song
118,"shut up idiot, and listen  to the  fucking  song  to the  end -  then  you speak  your  shit  comments -  what  the hell ! Man  you  really  are   very , very idiot  -  My God !"

133,This is my favorite song
134,Freddie mercury is an angel
135,"It’s a song about dying from aids. “Put my gun up to his head, pull my trigger now he’s dead…” is a euphemism for… yeah…"

144,"To fully understand this song, u gotta know Freddie&#39;s history a bit &gt; When he was just a kid he was sent to boarding school in another country ( &quot;mama, just killed man, meaning himself before he was sent away for boarding school where he was very close with his mom) , leaving him alone n vulnarable... Very lonely, with no family around! That&#39;s the first part, then they moved to London finds a band wheer he was eventually the lead singer, but times sucked for them. It felt like hell ( that&#39;s the middle part). But FReddie never gave up.... And after that it turns out, with his 3 other teammates, he concered the world with his talent and no family around! He IS till this day still A GOD!! The world will never forget him!!!"

172,Ayo I understand you just watching this for the first time. But it’s BLASPEMY PAUSING THIS
173,"Dude......i knw I&#39;m late ta THIS show, but Freddie Mercury...A GREAT ONE he was. RIP Freddie ❤"
174,Try Stevie Ray Vaughn life without you capitol theater  note the the guitar swap early
175,"45 years ago the bar was set ,it hasn&#39;t been touched since ! Thank you Queen  for the true Art of music  !"
176,So unwatchable. Listen to lyrics and stop screaming and saying “Bro” every sentence.
177,Sir pls reaction bohamia....black gryphon version
178,"Freddy Mercury. Queen was unique. This is their most unique song. Parts are autobiographical of Freddy&#39;s life. He was gay and his very conservative parents rejected him. The man he killed was his old closeted self when he came out to his parents. Lots of gut-wrenching emotions there. Not wanting to die but sometimes wishing he had never been born. Sorry, he made them cry but had to move on with his life. Other parts of the song are just pure musical creativity. If you have to put it in a genre, Rock Opera would be it maybe."
179,Just think ....you used to CHANGE THE CHANNEL  every time..... kinda crazy now  ..... they dont do music like the 70s and 80s anymore.... they were all gems back then ...

187,Lol badass reaction bro.
188,U cant not love this guy
189,"Around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m16s"">6:16</a> and up gives me some damn Willy Wonka vibes cuz ayoo😂😂😂😂😂"
190,When Shaq reacted to the gay rapper I died 😆.  The greatest reactions ever
191,Maybe it was Freddies coming out song. He &quot;killed&quot; the old Freddle who didn&#39;t want to live with a lie anymore 🤔

216,I love seeing someone’s first time reaction to Queen and the incredible Freddy Mercury!
217,"Reaction is understanable.  Queen is one of many Legendary Rock Bands of its time and of all time.  Lyrics, vocals and music all matches amazingly without the listener even realising.  It&#39;s not a light song.  Hence the recognition almost half a century later.  Apparently song was released in 1975 and members of the band were in their 20s when they wrote, sang, played and performed this song to success. Apologies if info is wrong but eitherway this song is epic and it came from Queen."
218,Look up Freddy mercury he is escaped war zone when he was 6 or 7 yrs old I’m not if Iran or Iraq    Beautiful soul Freddy mercury 💛🙏

233,The storey behind this song is he was sent a letter by a prisoner on death row. So that what I’ve heard
234,You can not turn the radio off this song!!  Never!!
235,Why are random fingernails like an inch long? Do African&#39;s in America not own nail clippers?
236,Is this guy speaking English? I cannot understand a word he&#39;s saying and I&#39;m a near native English speaker. What language is this?

243,The whole band is awesome they all have talent. Queen was the best band back in the day. Won&#39;t say my age haha lol
244,"He was dying of aids , an passed it on , ‘killed a man ‘ wished he was not born gay , wished never born at at all I guess"
245,Someone: what do you think is the hardest thing to do?<br>Me: To react to Bohemian Rhapsody and don&#39;t feel more then 1 emotion
246,"I am a black female, 26 years old and I know all the classic rock bands! The lead singer name is Freddy Mercury, but unfortunately he passed away 😢"
247,Freddie is not an angel....He&#39;s a god💯An Brian on those solos.....Perfection.
248,Happy Christmas morning to Halloween quickly..<br>🤣🤣<br>This song has 3 songs in one 🤣🤣🤣
249,"Ok, so Freddie Mercury had met a famous opera singer and he was fascinated with her voice. He decided that even as a rock band, he wanted to put together something operatic and this is the result. Also, mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead. He&#39;d been diagnosed with AIDS, and that&#39;s what he was referring to. Like, body aching all the time, too late my time has come, I&#39;ve got to go- all that relates to AIDS especially when it first came out and nobody knew what it was or how it was spread. I know I&#39;m late but I just found this channel. Awesome content!!"

262,"The coolest thing is to see reactions to Queen, especially Bohemian Rhapsody... The saddest thing is when they find out Freddie Mercury died 30 years ago and realize that there will never be more Queen songs."

What the fuck!? WHAT THE FUCK!?!?&quot; 😂 when she got to school she couldn&#39;t even remember the name of the song because it melted her brain. She went up to one of her friends to ask if she had heard it and before she could even say anything her friend was like &quot;OH MY GOD DID YOU HEAR THAT SONG ON THE RADIO THIS MORNING!?&quot; Neither of them could remember the name so they went over to a group of mutual friends and all of them turned to her and were like &quot;OH MY GOD DID YOU HEAR THAT SONG ON THE RADIO!?!?&quot;<br><br>Not a single mf in the school could remember the song, but damn near every one of them heard it. 😂😂😂"

La j&#39;ai juste en vie d&#39;aller me coucher mais cette vidéo est si honteuse qu&#39;il faut dire qqch.....:Sache &quot;No life shaq&quot; que ta réaction n&#39;est pas crédible du tout. Tu ne fais que charcuter cette chanson en la coupant sans l&#39;apprécier pleinement. Et tout ça, pour exprimer tes multiples effets de surprise si mal joués que ça en est insupportable,...... voire même gênant ......3,37M d&#39;abonnés.....comme quoi, le succès et la qualité sont deux choses qui ne sont pas forcément liées."
309,"CAP! NO CHANCE YOU HAVEN&#39;T HEARD THIS SONG BEFORE. THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS SONG IN RECENT HISTORY. Luv your stuff Shaq, but no chance my guy"
310,He said Queen don&#39;t sound like Rock and Roll yet. Lol haha!! Lost my shit
311,"Even if the QUEEN starts rapping in this, i won&#39;t be shocked"
312,He needs to react to the live aid performance Queen did in 1985. Literally everyone needs to see it
313,Freddy mercury
314,That&#39;s the best explanation I have ever heard about Queen is the Queen is there bipolar.... Go from opera to rock to soft music. That is funny as hell
315,Yep that&#39;s Queen baby..... They switch stuff up like you wouldn&#39;t believe one minute it&#39;s rock and roll 1 minute it&#39;s opera

328,“WhAt ThE fUcK iS gOiNg On” killed me
329,"I believe the beginning lyrics are a metaphor, if I’m not mistaken this was when he got aids, he then passed it on to his lover who died from it. The song is about Freddie knowing he’s going to die from aids."
330,&quot;These boys went from a happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick.&quot; <br>Bruh that comnent killed me😂😂😂☠

336,"You&#39;re right only Queen.  The singer is Freddie Mercury.  Queen was the name of the band  Freddy wrote Bohemian Rhapsody when he was 29.  I learned this in the movie.  The song is 3 songs he blended together.  The band members had their input during recording and each of them is a genius in their own regard.  There will never EVER be another Freddie Mercury.  He died at 42 of AIDS.  He chose the lifestyle he followed and he didn&#39;t care who knew.  He didn&#39;t apologize to anyone.  Hell, I don&#39;t blame him.  Queen&#39;s performance at Live Aid in July 1985 at Wembley stadium in London to a crowd of almost 75,000 people in the stadium alone went down as the best performance in history.  Thanks again for the great reaction."

341,"your reaction was priceless, just as Freddie Mercury deserved."
342,Brilliant 😂😂😂
343,I know this is old but if you like this song listen to welcome to the black parade by my chemical romance. It was directly inspired by this very song and is phenomenal in its own rite
344,The braids version.
345,Yo Shaq just wanted to let you know that you&#39;re my favorite reaction channel. Keep it up brother!
346,Bucks won 2021 <br>So maybe it&#39;s destined for me to watch this🔥
347,You should react to black hole sun next
348,HIS NAME IS FREDDIE MERCURY OF qUEEN-
349,Yo Shaq these don’t sounds like typical rock songs which are loud and heavy. These songs are called rock ballads which tend to be more soft and emotional.
350,Bro your reaction killed me so much respect for other genre&#39;s! Welcome to UK music you&#39;ll in deep now bro! 🇬🇧
351,This was a great “first time” Queen was way ahead of their time ♥️♥️♥️
352,"The main singer is named Freddy Mercury, they actually released a movie about him joining Queen. The movie is called Bohemian Rhapsody.<br>The meaning of the song itself is constantly up for debate but the general agreement is that it starts out with the main character telling his mom about how he killed someone and has to say goodbye because he&#39;s getting into a shoot out. It ends with the main character.<br>Queen is iconic, and Freddy Mercury was (according to my parents who&#39;ve seen him perform live) AMAZING at audience interactions."
353,This start is no funny
354,“What the fuck is goin on?!” Lololololol I died
355,he is never heard of F.Mercury before ??? where do you live????
356,I&#39;m a heterosexual Black dude and I love me some got damn Bohemian Rhapsody! I was a teenager and I guess I caught this the second time around and after it was released in the 70s. I heard it through Wayne and Garth on Wayne&#39;s World. Freddie Mercury was gay and was saying he killed his old self who was trying to be what everyone wanted him to be and he figured fuck that HERE I GO!!!
357,Shaq wearing the Bucks hat 3 years ago is the reason they wont the finals this year
358,"You paused in the middle of a guitar solo and every other highlight so go back and listen one more time! Me think you missed most of the song, seriously! This masterpiece has been listened to by 1/5 of the planet and you blew straight through it! 🙄"
359,You really should the &#39;Bohemian Rhapsody&#39; movie. One of the best movies I&#39;ve watched.

364,"Bro, ...&quot;What the Fuuuuck&quot; yep"
365,You have to put this song into the context of its era. Freddy was a gay man with aids or the worry of getting aids. That is what this song is really about. You gotta love queen and Freddie Mercury!

369,this is BS everyone has heard Bohemian Rhapsody
370,&quot;I&#39;ve heard this a million times on the radio and I would always turn it.&quot; Classic!
371,&quot; I don&#39;t know whether to throw my phone or call my mama.&quot; Best reaction line of all time.
372,"&quot;Who is this singer right here, What his name?&quot;<br><br>Me: :&#39;("
373,That was great. I&#39;ve heard this song for 42 years. And I never considered it the way you just reviewed it. Queen is bipolar. Perfect. Thanks for a great laugh on a rainy day my friend. We should be able to rate videos You would get a 5 out of 5.
374,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m52s"">6:52</a>. I’ve never laughed so hard in my life."
375,"I find it very hard to believe that someone hasn&#39;t heard this song ever before?  Sad <br>really more people should listen to more genres and broaden their &quot;music spectrum&quot; <br>I still think a lot of people immediately dismiss something simply based on a surface <br>level examination when there&#39;s a shit ton of depth to absolutely everything in life."
376,"Yep, Freddie Mercury, one of the best voices you will ever hear regardless of genre."
377,Oh Yes Queen

399,"This is the best! I hope you did more queen reactions. All of their songs are unique. It would’ve been really cool for you to react to “crazy little thing called love” <br>If you don’t know Queen, you’d never know it was the same band"

406,I appreciate the fact he was honest when he recognized parts of it instead of pretending you&#39;ve never heard it.  And it&#39;s Freddie Mercury.
407,Everyone first time listening to the song with the video<br>&quot;What kind of witchcraft is going on here?&quot;
408,"&#39;Bohemian Raphsody&#39; is considered not only the best-selling but the greatest single of all time. Its more like a play of various acts than a song, portrayed in a way no modern group can. Thats why Queen also is considered the  2nd best music group after Beatles, and its vocalist Freddie Mercury is in a constant comparison with Frank Sinatra for the best vocalist of all time."
409,"I’m two years late, but as of this video, you’ve officially been blessed by the magic flash of lightning that was Freddie Mercury. I used to turn this song off, too, until I realized exactly who he and Queen were and what this song was to him. It was a friggin master class in everything he’d ever learned over the course of his career as a vocalist and musician. It’s a singularly genius composition, crossing styles, octaves, and tempos so effortlessly...mens went from belting out a ballad to legit opera to face-smashing rock anthem in the space of seven minutes. They were a definitional phenomenon for the music industry."
410,They invented music  videos  &amp; the biggest hit record in history!  It&#39;s kind of a modern  opera.
411,"Freddie  Mercury, vocals &amp; piano. He created  this masterpiece.  This was 1975. True genius!"
412,When you did that rhythm I was like what other song are you mentioning? 😂😂😂
413,There are documentaries on all the artists you cover.
414,&quot;I&#39;m gettin all KINDS of emotions from this song!&quot;<br><br>Same. Exact same.

441,"Nothing can prepare  you for Bo Rap. Made  in 1975.  Lead singer: Freddie  Mercury.  Guitar: Brian May. Bass : John  Deacon.  Drums: Roger Taylor. Not an ordinary  band, they were together  20yrs,  1970-1990. They were the top rock band in the world most of  that time &amp;  stole the show at Live Aid in front of a packed  stadium  of 72,000. Google Live Aid &amp; watch the video ( their part is 20 minutes.) You can learn a lot @ them on Google &amp; You Tube. Freddie  had a 4 octave vocal range &amp; could literally sing anything from blues to opera( which he  loved.) In 1989 he had a hit song , album  called  Barcelona , a collaboration with  opera star Montserrat Caballet.  He also performed with the Royal  Ballet, at their  request, for charity.  The Oscar winning  movie (2018) is based on their story."

473,"People when they get past the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m00s"">3:00</a> mark of Bohemian Rhapsody: 😳"
474,shaq enjoi  mark knopfler romeo and juliette night  in london
475,At the end... Freddie Mercury was a legend
476,The song took over12 years to make
477,He was talking about himself being gay and telling His mother.... And just wanted to be like others
478,"You should react to Pentatonix singing this song... a’Capella, no instruments! Freddy Mercury is one of the top rock singers ever and Queen one of the top band! This is a classic!"
479,Yeah this is fake
480,How dare you paused it in between that epic solo.!
481,That was a bar tho. He said he didn’t wanna die but wishes he was never born :(
482,His performance at live aid seemed better
483,Watch the movie about him Freddie Mercury. It’s the name of this song
484,Yeah it&#39;s a Rhapsody
485,Yeah it&#39;s a Rhapsody
486,it&#39;s about him killing someone going court and being left to die in prison? (maybe)
487,"Being dead in one ear, the concept of stereo is lost to me. All my speakers are on one side of my room."
488,"You don’t seem to connect with people, at least not with us here watching. You are looking in every direction but ours. Makes you feeling off. I don’t feel connection, I see a strange dude....."
489,What&#39;s probably the most impressive thing about this song... Is Freddie Mercury wrote every single note.. every harmony.. every guitar lick..  everything...  There will never be another Freddie Mercury!!
490,👇🏻 This is the number of times Shaq said “Hold up!”
491,ᶜᵃⁿ ᵃⁿʸᵒⁿᵉ ˢᵉᵉ ᵐʸ ᵗᶦⁿʸ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ
492,This is a masterpiece darling
493,Freddy Mercury greatest vocalist of all time
494,Tribute concert for Freddy mercury had Elton John &amp; Axl Rose performs live
495,It&#39;s not fair to let people listen to the world&#39;s greatest song without any warning.
496,“I don’t know whether I wana throw my phone at my momma or call my momma and tell her I love her” 😂 that made me laugh so fùckin hard 😂! You should listen to the show must go on by Queen!
497,Yet another fake reaction
498,His name is Freddie murcary
499,I love how he wants to pause to talk but simply cant because.. Well.. Its queen
500,That&#39;s Freddie Mercury who is arguably the best singer ever recorded with more vocal range than any other.
501,dude u paused it at the guitar solo
502,I’ll give you a dollar if you can guess why they’re named Queen 😂
503,put sum respekt on Freddie&#39;s name shaq
504,The guitarist is the Queens astrophysicist...
505,This song is around 45 years old.
506,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>your reaction tho....loved it
507,That would be the late great Freddie Mercury. He kills a man... asks everyone to move on then gets pissed when they do!  How u gonna love me and leave me to die!
508,I watched your reaction when you first posted it and many times since......really fun!  I was 21 when this song was first released.  Loved it then......still love it now.  Such a legendary band and iconic song.  All four band members so talented with Freddie Mercury leading the way.  Brian May and the Bohemian Rhapsody guitar solo recently named the best rock guitarist and rock guitar  solo of all time.💛💛💛
509,"&quot;they sound like angels&quot; easy boy, you&#39;re going to hear the devil next when the guitar solo kicks in!"
510,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m05s"">5:05</a> is my favorite part 🔥🔥🔥"

512,The greatest song of all time
513,"Man ! I saw several dozen reactions to Bohemian Rhapsody, But you ! lol <br>You&#39;re just the best! And I can say Welcome to the Queen Family!"
514,You can&#39;t possibly know how happy you make me! Keep up the fantastic work my friend!
515,Arent ya worry you kept turning it off all those years!  I can’t help but wonder WHAT you kids listen to today?!  Does nothing ever “change up” in your music?  Some day I gotta find out.
516,I do that too during a moment of &quot;Feeling&quot; I look behind me to get validation on those &quot;Feelings&quot; and yet no one is ever there or is someone?
517,The song is about Freddie Mercury coming out and killing his old identity
518,<b>f i r s t  T I M E</b>
519,Might be best song ever written... and I&#39;m not a rock fan.
520,Is this dude the voice actor for yondu or some shit

525,Brian may needs to see this video it may heal his heart
526,"I was waiting for that last part, to see how he reacts"
527,One of my favorite queen songs
528,This album was designed as a rock opera; this being one movement.
529,Not only is it a compulsory requirement for 6yo in the U.K. to be able to air guitar to this; every uk citizen has to be able to sing to this whenever needed....the national anthem comes second..
530,Lol it&#39;s queen you dont think just feel. Luv your channel keep up the good work!🤗😁😎
531,"I know what to watch when I need to smile or laugh more.  He gives out the best reactions.  It&#39;s hilarious the way he abruptly gets out of his chair and ends up on the  other side of the room.  He took the words right out of my mouth, after I described it as a rollercoaster ride."
532,Freddie: Pulled my trigger now he’s dead😔<br><br>Shaq: <b>PSHHHHHHHHHHHH🤣🤣🤣</b>
533,The first MTV.
534,It’s Queen that’s the only explanation
535,Do not 🚫 pause when Brian May is doing his Guitar 🎸 Solo<br>.
536,"There are 5 parts in this song, the Acapella, the Ballad the Operatic parts or section, Rock and,Coda<br>."

552,NEVER NEVER NEVER CUT A SOLO GUITAR
553,I just followed you since I heard Em&#39;s MTBMB Side B and your reactions to those and other Em songs. Queen was and still is at the top. Freddie Mercury is on a whole other level compared to other artists in the rock world like Em is to the hip-hop world.

575,"Queen is always great and it is rumored that when Queen were in Australia in 1974 they heard Eve Part 1,2,3 by Steven Wright and was Freddy Mercury&#39;s inspiration for the rock opera length Bohemian Rhapsody. True or not who knows? Here is the link to the song remastered with a put together fan video. Hope you do a reaction to it.<br>This classic rock song is almost a national anthem here in Australia and deserves wider recognition worldwide. Enjoy.<br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOFexMWQ1Gs&amp;ab_channel=simmo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOFexMWQ1Gs&amp;ab_channel=simmo</a>"

582,"I wanna know who is in the chair when he gets up???? @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m03s"">7:03</a> I can&#39;t stop laughing!!!!"

604,"To  anyone that does not know,the Bohemian rapsody was written just after Freddy Mercury  discovered he had AIDS and was going go die,  so when hes singing about dying and not wanting to die,its actually for real not just song lyrics, its a sad and very beautiful song ."

649,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m23s"">6:23</a>"
650,"that got about everything,opera etc"

660,he was saying he wish he wasnt born cause he was born with aids
661,his name is freddie murcery
662,Freddie Mercury fascinated with a fat Spanish chick that sings opera and then does it better.
663,"Thank u for making me laugh so hard for real I mean it..im not sure if after this reaction z year ago if u did anymore research but Freddy mercury has legendary songs like Michael Jackson has, but ur reaction when u heard the music go from one side to the other on your headphones,well it was awesome to watch."
664,"I haven&#39;t laughed that hard in a long time. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m24s"">6:24</a> gave me an injury"
665,Prince often talked about his love for Queen
666,Freddy Mercury is the singer.
667,It’s based on operatic singing.
668,a real MASTERPIECE!
669,"to shaq,by far my fav reaction,fucking cracking me  up my dude 🤘🤘🤘"
670,One of the greatest pieces of music ever constructed.
671,"I had to sub because of your realness. Deadass how it felt first time i heard it, this song is meant to be everywhere and give you every emotion thats why queen is one of the greatest"
672,Rip Freddie ❤🙂
673,Freddie Mercury was one of the best vocalists of all time. Too bad we lost him so early
674,Remember when the Muppets did a cover of this but it was shit?
675,Asrtists: breath <br>Shaq: thats though
676,Probably the best rock song ever recorded
677,"his name is &quot;Freddie Mercury&quot;, the singer of queen"
678,His name is Freddie Mercury
679,Does this guy ever shut up and listen? How can u react to a song that you are not taking any notice of and keep interrupting . It’s like watching a two year old
680,"If you want a saddy, try Faithfully by Journey"
681,That&#39;s what i love when hip hop guys listen to real rock music!!
682,British people doing some weird shit.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>But ist still make it look good.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Facts
683,&quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot;  ... lol.
684,How have I not seen this reaction! Just spent the entire day binge watching your reacts and came across this beauty 😂😂😂 I love you a lil more for this !!
685,Hi my name is paul from over the pond listen to queens classic innuendo aswell I rate it like all his songs don&#39;t think you seen innuendo may be wrong thou
686,My favorite version of this is when it’s end blends into the beginning of we are the champions
687,when shaq says pruffffff and jumps around the room and talk <br>me : i will go to the toilet
688,This is ho many times Shaq has said “That’s Tough”<br><br>🔽
689,“Am i tripping or these niggas sound like angels”😂😂
690,I have another song you may want to react to. This is heavy metal music. The band is called Megadeth and their song is called Symphony of Destruction.
691,Awesome.<br><br>&quot;Before I opened my horizons.&quot;
692,"Lol... when he says he put a gun against a mans head and killed him, there’s some level of allegory to it... he’s the man. The gun was his rock and roll lifestyle... and yeah, for Freddie Mercury, it killed him in the end."
693,"Listen to Agust d’s DAECHWITA or BTS’ Dis-ease, or Telepathy"
694,Shaq lowkey sound like Yondu from Guardians of the Galaxy
695,"“How Can he say something so brutal so nicely”<br><br>Tell you what, it’s a metaphor. He didn’t like the person people expected himself to be. His name used to be Farrokh Bulsara but he himself changed it to Freddie Mercury. He wanted to change himself completely so he can become the person he actually wishes to be. That’s why he put a gun against his old self’s head, “pulled my trigger now he’s dead” <br>“Mama life had just begun”= the life he aspires to have has now begun.<br><br>He wants to tell people that you can be who you want to be and not live under other people’s standards."
696,Fortunately you&#39;ve watched and listened this fenomenal song video. Nowadays many young kids didn&#39;t know Queen and their songs.
697,pull them pants up
698,"I&#39;m seriously stunned everytime someone says they don&#39;t know the legends Queen, they made Rock you, Bohemian Rhapsody amzing songs."
699,One of the greatest songs ever.

703,You should do a reaction to Tesla ( love song)
704,Im comin in with some mild hate to tell yall this man has 3 different videos entitled &quot;first reaction to Queen&quot;. THATS TUFF SHAQ
705,I love this guy
706,My first time watching your videos. I dint know an adult never heard Queen. But after watching you instantly see what makes them a legend justifies their position as one of the greatest bands of all time
707,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m12s"">3:12</a> kkkkk"

719,"<b>&quot;I&#39;m raging on this side and crying on this side.&quot;</b> - exactly, that&#39;s the point: that&#39;s why really <b>good</b> rock music <i>seems</i> bipolar. It&#39;s supposed to act and function as emotional expulsion. An expression of frustration which allows for a cathartic release."
720,💜♥️💙💗
721,His name is freddy Murcery

HahHaha!!!  3 fav moments- an acapella xmas carol type arrangement w lyrics confess a murder! <br>Then transitioned to the rock you first expected, but immediately transitioned to a carnival - like sound... (I see a little silhouette etc- I think that’s the lyrics) Hahaha! Your reaction - Tears!  Then toward then end all the masks popping up- scared u .. “they went from Xmas to Halloween!” “Dey bipolar”!  He likely was! <br>The reality- absolute brilliance right?!!

755,I listened to this a lot in a time period of my life when I was moving everywhere like a gypsy with an alcohol problem.
756,"Freddy Mercury was gay. But his music didn&#39;t portal it as such. Not saying that&#39;s why he wore makeup. Gaga means theatrical, fun fact."
757,"Every rock fans view of an extremely epic song! Hey, watch Wayne&#39;s World the movie!!!"
758,When he says “wtf is going on”
759,QUEEN<br>&#39;nuff said.
760,"When he says he &quot;Killed a man&quot;, he&#39;s talking about killing the straight version of himself and came out and now he can&#39;t go back."
761,FREDDIE MERCURY
762,does this reactor say we&#39; funna come up with&quot; Yeah he says we funna come up... with hahahaha! i have never heard someone say &quot;funna&#39; i have heard gonna but funna NEVER!!!!!

764,"Queen: &quot;Never let me go&quot;<br>Him: &quot;Oh no, no, NO!&quot;"
765,Freddie Mercury
766,The song IMO is about suicide.
767,I love him to react to the scene where they get called Wankers in the movie

780,"The lead singer was Freddy Mercury.  A completely magnificent musical genius.  He wrote all the music his band played/sang.  And all the lyrics (words).  He played piano and some guitar.  This song is a &quot;rock opera&quot;, that&#39;s why it changes beats and pace throughout the song.  It was his greatest work and explains his journey through having AIDS/HIV, which he died from."
781,his name is freddy mercury and they&#39;re actually all gay
782,and a &quot;Rhapsody&quot; means multiple song styles in one song. You heard the hard rock flip later in the tune. Starts as a ballad. Ends with a Coda.
783,"Oh, I got a &quot;reaction&quot; from the most beautiful woman I&#39;ve ever seen when I had her play this. She was eating outta the palm of my HAND!<br><br>THANK YOU FREDDIE!!! U got me more p***y than I got myself lolololol"
784,This is your first big one my friend.<br>I appreciate everything you have done for me this year
785,You should try listening to the Slash Street Boys you will get a good laugh from them
786,"Hey man, “just killed a man, pulled my trigger now he’s dead” is a metaphor to say he has changed his life, he has killed his old soul, his old life. Freddie Mercury was homosexual so he used those words to tell it to his mama. When I first heard this peace of song I cried..."
787,Fake!!
788,omg when he says WTF is going on i lost it dude..... I FUCKING LOVE YOU LMAO!!!!!
789,He lowkey said what in the hell in an Asian accent

802,"Fun fact: Brian May, the lead guitarist for Queen plays his guitar with a coin and always has. Also made that guitar by hand with his dad from a 100 year old fireplace mantle when he was like 16. It&#39;s the only guitar he&#39;s ever used for a song or show really. Most likely the most valuable guitar in the world.<br>DATS TUFF!"

817,It has 1 billion views.
818,We soul lovers have changed this song back in our day too. Then we grew up and began listening. Broaden your mind and you will find beauty everywhere. Get out from under the rock. His name is Freddie Mercury. He has a Muslim back ground. I don&#39;t know if he practiced it but some of the words he uses are from the Muslim culture. &quot;Bismillah&quot; we will not let you go. He is talking about being forgiven for the sin he committed.  &quot;So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye&quot; He does not want them to just execute him by stoning. In the end he gives in.
819,Nobody like them......
820,Stereo man
821,Eddie Mercury Would have love to see your reaction.
822,"Queen is unique: each member has written a song that has got to Number One in the charts.  With today&#39;s level of &quot;talent&quot;, can&#39;t see anyone equalling that.<br>PS; songs in those days lasted 3-3 minutes at most.  They were told that radio DJs would never play a song as long as this.  Ha."
823,Freddie Mercury is THE GREATEST vocalist of all time!
824,"This made me cringe <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=2m49s"">2:49</a>"
825,Freddy Mercury.<br>is the lead singer.  His voice is unrivaled.
826,"What does the fox say<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m18s"">5:18</a>"
827,Freire mercury

830,This song is so special because he’s talking about how he had aids and that he was dying

833,I&#39;ve watched this so many times! My favourite reaction Everrrrr 🤣
834,Don&#39;t underestimate your parents era boy!
835,"This is the last video of Queen you should have watched.  Very much out of their &quot;wheelhouse&quot;.<br>Good video, but not typical.<br>And what does rock sound like to you?<br>Lead singer, Freddie Mercury, passed with complications from HIV.<br>Do you answer your comments?"
836,"Freddie Mercury is the singer, RIP."
837,He is the legend fredie murrcury died off aids😓
838,"The begin of the song should be listened to by any kid that wants to join a hard gangster gang. The kid noticing that he threw his life away by killing another man and what harm he had done by this to his mother and his family. The regret, the pain, ... he wished he has never been born at all."
839,"watches a Queen vid but doesn&#39;t know the singer, bruh, he Freddie Mercury, how tf could you not know, hahahahahahah"
840,FREDDIE MERCURY
841,"There is a &#39;vocal-play&#39; group called Naturally 7 and they sample <br>Bohemian Rhapsody on their cut &quot;Galileo feat. Queen&quot; ~ you obviously <br>liked Bohemian Rhapsody, &amp; I&#39;ll guarantee that you&#39;ll also like <br>Naturally 7&#39;s take on the song (I recommend the Official Music Video)."
842,"I honestly think Freddie Mercury is part African cuz every African American gets hyped when they listen to Queen and I’m not being racist even though it may sound like it but African American’s forsure have a special ear to way better music and when they recognize talent it’s most likely because it matches their’s, no one can deny they have a way better taste in music and Freddie parents are Indian but doesn’t have the Indian style so you he gotta have the southern Indian genes in him"
843,hey get this he can sing you cannot why not just be silent and LISTEN
844,They&#39;re not british
845,Bohemian Rhapsody is rock opera at it&#39;s best.
846,"That guitar player is Brian May.  He was working on his doctorate in astrophysics when Queen was formed.  So he put his studies aside to join the band. After Freddie Mercury&#39;s death, he resumed his work. He finally got his doctorate in 2006.  So he is actually Dr. Brian May Ph.D  His IQ has been measured in the 160&#39;s. He&#39;s written about a half dozen books and has worked with his father to design and build a new kind of guitar."
847,"Now why on earth would we warn about this classic song your reactions is the reasons why we do it sir and you didn&#39;t  disappoint too funny <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23datstuff"">#datstuff</a>"

873,"The song is abt Freddie, leaving his old self behind, and coming out, so the &#39; i killed a man&#39; is actually him stopping living like someone he&#39;s not"

I always knew it was amazing, but it took me years to truly experience and understand the layers of emotions here. Shaq understood it completely the first time through -- and truly gets it.

954,"I remember showing this to my ex&#39;s father in law and he switched to another video the second before the big guitar solo and switch of the song, it killed my soul....!! haha. I mean the build up was crazy, such an anti climax"
955,Do you ever look into the history after you listen to the songs?

971,"Don&#39;t know if anybody else mentioned it, but the guitarist is Brian May. <i>Doctor</i> Brian May, with a Ph.D. in astrophysics. He was working on his doctorate when Queen hit it big, so he put his research on hold, and finally went back and got his degree in 2007. He was also one of the collaborators on NASA&#39;s New Horizons mission to Pluto."
972,I would love for you to react to some elton John music. He&#39;s my favorite

976,Imagine hearing this song for the first time 👁👄👁
977,Freddy Mercuty is hands down one of the greatest rock singers to ever exist.
978,Watch the movie!! Netflix I think
979,"One of the Best songs EVER, if not the BEST SONG EVER...."
980,"The part of the song &quot;he don&#39;t want to die and wish he was never born&quot; was him expressing his regret for just killing a man, knowing he&#39;s going to get the death penalty for his crime."
981,"The Singer is Freddie Mercury and is by far one of the best singers EVER. He had 4 extra teeth, molars to be exact, which is what analysis says gave him the unique ability to span 4 octaves. I don&#39;t know music octaves but spanning 4 octaves is not common. In short the Average Joe is lucky to have 2 octaves, high and low, Freddie took this to unusually talented and gifted levels."
982,&quot;what the f is happening&quot;...and... Tea spat out laughing. Just what everyone thought when this came out and listened for the first time.
983,"They can be playing with you, because they are Queen, and you aren&#39;t."

994,"I&#39;ve seen so many of your reactions, just to bug out over songs I already know. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23realknowsreal"">#realknowsreal</a>"
995,"Check out cover by Marc Martel <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=RDtXBnlRFoWFY&amp;feature=share&amp;playnext=1"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=RDtXBnlRFoWFY&amp;feature=share&amp;playnext=1</a>"

997,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m11s"">3:11</a>.......I&#39;m done 😂😂😂😂"
998,"<b>this</b> is why so many people look down at Hiphop, <b>this</b> is exceptional. <b>this</b> is something not just anyone could do.<br><b>this</b> is musical genius at its finest.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there <b>is</b> hiphop that is genuinely spectacular., but most of it is really generic bullshit that any 8 year  old could&#39;ve made.<br><br><b>this</b> right here is <b>decades</b> of education and effort, perfecting their trade on top of the inherent talent of the people in it.<br><br>Queen was a &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; band and Freddy was a friggin God."
999,Freddie may look white but he was from Zanzibar and was of black heritage
1000,When he sat on his headphones 😂😂😂
1001,"U paused Brian May&#39;s guitar solo, thats illegal"
1002,"&quot;You are all[Queen] bipolar&quot;. Made me laugh, this."

1006,His name is Freddy murcary( sorry if I spelled that wrong ) he was taking about having aids
1007,Queen is the best of all times
1008,&quot;What tf is going on?!!!&quot; 😅😅😅
1009,Did he just sit on his headset 😂
1010,This song almost every year the number one song in holland
1011,I would really like your opinion on a 60s British song by the Hollies called ‘He ain’t heavy he’s my brother’ better if you can get the words with it...it’s really emotional and beautiful and was the funeral song choice many times. Love your reviews. Stay safe.
1012,I think they telling the boys story. He shot the dad and mom took the blame. He was abused by his father. That&#39;s just my opinion I have no idea.
1013,I can&#39;t stop laughing!!!!
1014,&quot;what the f*** is going on?&quot; lmfao
1015,This song always amazes me. Lyrically he could be talking about his illness with aids... But this was written long before. Kinda eerie in a way
1016,Freddy was amazing. G.O.A.T all the way. You should watch the movie.
1017,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> that is getting blown up and framed for my living room 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
1018,Best reaction ever!  You summed it up perfectly! I can&#39;t stop laughing though
1019,Lmfao lol
1020,I want you to do QUEEN LIVE AID PERFORMANCE!!!!!!
1021,wuwuwu~~~~~~ dats tuff!
1022,"Queen with the best coming out of the closet song of all time. And Freddie was so good, nobody caught it and thus the song was a hit in a time where the gay experience was hard. The whole 1st verse is him killing himself destroying the man he was and becoming the man he would be. Also, his mother and community were very religious, and he knew they wouldn&#39;t understand. There&#39;s a part about his bandmates in the middle, and then it goes right back into his struggles. This guy was a genious."
1023,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m06s"">3:06</a> wasn&#39;t ready for that loooool"
1024,Love the Bucks hat!
1025,Who is this singer...
1026,&quot;what the fuck is going on!?&quot; Spot on lol
1027,Ain&#39;t nobody ever like queen. They were such a different sounding band. Masters of music. Love all their music.
1028,React to Innuendo please. It s the Bohemian Rhapsody of 1991.<br>An other bloody Masterpiece so that Freddie was almost die he had a great voice even at the end of his life...
1029,"Freddy Mercury R.I.P. If you want to watch their best live performance, watch Live Aid. It is deemed the best Rock live performance of all time. Freddy’s command of his audience was something to see."
1030,"😂😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m18s"">5:18</a> He said ooOOOOOOOOUUUuuuuuuUUOOOOO 😮🗣️"
1031,Easily one of my favorite reactions on your channel bro!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1032,FREDDIE MERCURY!!!!!!!   THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!<br>80&#39;s are the BEST!   ALL you BIG BABIES BEEN MISSIN&quot; OUT!!! You can&#39;t handle the talent!
1033,Uncultured swine how do you have this many followers
1034,Crazy part is the song is about Freddy Mercury giving people HIV.
1035,"See, music snobbery has a lot to answer for. You know dude, if this comes on, let it play. If your friends give you shit, tell them, &quot;shut the fuck up and listen - it\ll change your life&quot;. That dude is Freddy Mercury, the finest rock vocalist who has ever existed. Oh, and for this particular song, don&#39;t try and find meaning in the lyrics. they are supposed to be nonsensical. This is the first EVER music video that isn&#39;t just live footage, and it cost about 4,500 pounds to make in 1975."
1036,My guy......you have me cracking up!....great reaction!!
1037,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m55s"">6:55</a> &quot;Yo wtf goin on&quot; lmfao"

1039,My boy is feeling what we all felt the first time we heard this song.
1040,YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY...EMPTY VESSELS...
1041,"Everybody has heard Queen, why lie?"
1042,"Blows people&#39;s minds when they hear actual music with diversity in a single song. Real creativity and inspiration went into all the classic rock we know and love. That&#39;s why it&#39;s timeless, and you can&#39;t listen to it without it striking a chord within you."
1043,"The rumor about the song is that Freddie is singing about his own shame and eventual death resulting from having HIV/AIDS. But the song was realized in 1975 long before the HIV/AIDS pandemic and before he was ever diagnosed. The lyrics very STRONGLY relate to this. It’s very eerie and sad and hauntingly beautiful. Maybe Freddie somehow knew his fate. Not sure I believe in stuff like that but the song is very... prescient to say the least. A true God Tier Masterpiece, this song."
1044,Have respect brilliant record nothing ever like it
1045,Ok do paradise by the dashboard light
1046,His reaction was fun. When this song came out that is how everyone reacted.  &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;  Then. &quot; I gotta hear that again. &quot;
1047,This one needs a Barology vid.
1048,I&#39;ve never seen someone react to the killed a man part that way lol
1049,&quot;Went from A happy christmas mornin to halloween reaaal quick!&quot; wahahahahh PERFECT !!!!

1052,You won’t turn the channel the next time you hear it
1053,"I love you brother!  You make it so i can&#39;t wait until you hear a new one. Bruv,  thanx for being you man!  If you get a chance, sir, please check out:  the offspring, album called ignition, song called &quot; l.a.p.d.&quot;  and,  if you can, read the lyrics first or during cuz it might help my brother out.   Peace and love my bruv!  Go Steelers!"
1054,His voice sounds like he swallowed a cheese grater
1055,You just made my night best reactions ever 🤣🤣🤣
1056,"He was singing about his own death...When he said momma just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead.  Then said he had to go but then said he don&#39;t wanna die, sometimes wished he never been born at all... It was his coming out song.  He was singing about his being infected with AIDs and he was dying.  Ended up his farewell opera, more or less..."
1057,It’s tough to say this isn’t the greatest song ever written. As overplayed as it is there truly is nothing like it
1058,what an idiot !
1059,His face tho<br>... What the fuck is going on?!?! <br>Hahahaha
1060,Dude- you were totally entertaining! Christmas - to Halloween. loved that.
1061,“He can sing his ass off tho “
1062,Your reaction has the right level of appreciation and analysis xx
1063,You need to listen to it again without stopping it and just let it all seep in.  This song is a unique masterpiece.  I wish I could go back and hear it for the first time again.  I LOVE this song and I have heard it hundreds of times.

1066,"Never, ever again, cut a Brian May solo. First warning."
1067,This guy just had his mind blown.
1068,This is amazing. I’ve been smiling the whole time
1069,Best take on this song! So brutal yet sounds like an angel while saying it.
1070,"Freddie got a lot of heat from the record producers because of the length of the song. He didn&#39;t back down, he knew he had a masterpiece."
1071,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m44s"">7:44</a> That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard Shaq swear. Queen really brings out the emotion in people"
1072,The singer Had an extra pair of teeth which increases your vocal range
1073,"Brian May, back in the early days, used to like playing with the stereo so sounds switched left and right.<br><br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m53s"">6:53</a>, our man Shaq figured this out hard!!!"
1074,Freddie mercury <br>The legend

1076,U know why they have no queen cover bands is becuz freddie cant be imitated
1077,"You act the same way to every rock song come on man you can’t like em all, it sounds like you’re just trying to get them white boy likes and subs"
1078,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m50s"">6:50</a> - &quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON???&quot; Hahaha"
1079,I love how much fun this guy has by himself. !
1080,Let people think you are an ignorant twit than open your pie-hole and confirm it! I was born in 2000 and I know who Queen were/are - one of biggest rock groups in history.
1081,The guy doing this vid is a knob!
1082,Watch the movie Bohemian Rhapsody.  The story of queen and their front man Freddie Mercury.  You will understand them much better.  He wrote this as a rock opera.
1083,Bro- watch the movie about them.  &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; 2018 release.  Very deep.
1084,I CRIED EVERY TIME I HEARD THIS SONG BRUH
1085,"Yeah that&#39;s nice but I like Earth Wind &amp; Fire better. React to this, it&#39;s short and sweet.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f-jQxceV6o"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f-jQxceV6o</a>"
1086,"Freddy Mercury was one of the greatest singers, vocalists, frontmen of all time! Brian May (guitarist) is also one of yhe greatest of all time. Personally speaking, We Will Rock You, as simple as it is, is one of the greatest songs of all time."
1087,I LOVE you man!
1088,Dawg lol
1089,There is no way he hasn’t heard this song before
1090,Lol. It doesn’t sound like rock.  Wait for it.

1094,Freddy Mercury -- probably one of the best names for a lead singer.
1095,You would definitely enjoy the movie they made. Same name as this song. It touched just the tip of the iceberg of their lives.
1096,&quot;These n*<b>**</b> sound like angels!&quot; 🤣🤣🤣
1097,You wouldn&#39;t believe that they saying Another One Bites the Dust We Are The Champions and we will rock you

1167,"J&#39;ai regardé plusieurs de ses vidéos , genre le mec il est passé à coté de absolument tout , de trucs tellement cultissime alors qu&#39;il a +30 ans , c&#39;est franchement dur à croire , et c&#39;est pas comme si ces chansons ne passaient jamais dans des films, pubs, séries , radio ,  soirée, mariage , vidéos youtube  etc... etc... on les entends encore partout même de nos jours il faut qu&#39;il m&#39;explique comment il fait car même en le faisant exprès je n&#39;y arriverait pas lol. Il connait Michael Jackson du coup ou pas !!? il va nous faire une réaction aussi  ?!!  Je veux vraiment croire qu&#39;il n&#39;a jamais entendu ces morceaux , sinon je suis obligé de penser qu&#39;il nous prend vraiment pour des cons(à clic) lol<br>----- <br>I watched several of his videos, like the guy missed absolutely everything, such cult stuff but he&#39;s +30 years old, it&#39;s very hard to believe, and it&#39;s not as if these songs never appeared in films, pubs, series, radio, party, wedding, youtube videos etc ... etc ... we still hear them everywhere even nowadays,  he has to explain to me how he does it because even by doing it on purpose I couldn&#39;t do it lol. So he knows Michael Jackson or not !!? he will give us a reaction too? !! I really want to believe he never heard these songs, otherwise I have to think he really takes us for dumbs clickers lol"

1172,Freddie was from India
1173,Freddie Mercury that&#39;s the lead singers name
1174,Freddy Mercury is a god
1175,The more times you say WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? the better the song.
1176,Dude had AIDS and was dying.. Fucking do some research...
1177,"I am an old lady, I hate 4 letter words, but I just enjoyed your reaction so much, laughed my head off!  Queen, just about the greatest band of all time, Freddie Mercury, just about the greatest showmen of all time, with just about the best song of all time!"
1178,I&#39;m here from Gus Johnson😂
1179,What the fuck is going on!!! Hahahaha
1180,That is Freddie Mercury.
1181,"I love it.....because you’re feeling some thing and it takes a great artist to make you feel anything..... <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23queen"">#Queen</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ilovefreddie"">#ILoveFreddie</a> 👑💚"
1182,Freddie Mercury.  Died from aids.  The world lost a huge talent when he passed.  R.I.P. Freddie.
1183,This don&#39;t sound like rock<br><br>And this is wear the operatic section comes in
1184,Best f’ing reaction on YT. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
1185,Hes so shook at Rodger Taylors falsetto
1186,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m53s"">6:53</a> I was laughing so God damn hard I hyperventilated into my CPAP machine!"
1187,Ceo of : that’s tuff
1188,Now you need to react to Angelina Jordan doing this song it is f*<b>***</b> amazing.
1189,Do we will rock you and we are the champion by queen please like so he can see this
1190,Best song ever written
1191,My music knowledge goes all over the place from Nina Simone did the Beatles to Led Zeppelin to Tupac to. Nipsey Hussle to Sam Cooke and on and on. That said me and my friends are often debated whether this is the greatest song ever made. And for the record I grew up on Tupac like f*** rock and roll so yeah
1192,"I didn&#39;t know that the people like this exist who haven&#39;t heard BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY Yet, I can understand if your just a kid coz this will be too old for you but if your not, then your life is Incomplete.<br>I mean take me as example, I&#39;m just turned 20 and  English is Not my first language, I&#39;m the only person in my Family who can understand English, means there is no one who can tell me about QUEEN or any other artists, but still I found about This Legendary Band, without Searching for them"
1193,"I didn&#39;t know that the people like this exist who haven&#39;t heard BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY Yet, I can understand if your just a kid coz this will be too old for you but if your not, then your life is Incomplete.<br>I mean take me as example, I&#39;m just turned 20 and  English is Not my first language, I&#39;m the only person on my Family who can understand English, means there is no one who can tell me about QUEEN or any other artists, but still I found about This Legendary Band, without Searching for them"
1194,That&#39;s Freddie Mercury in his young days. The music industry didn&#39;t want to produce the song Bohemian Rhapsody because they said it was too long...6 minutes. Freddie told the producer that he pitied his wife if he thought 6 minutes was too long. LOL. Unfortunately he died in November 1991 with Aids related pneumonia. He is sorely missed. You should see him sing it when he was older.
1195,Please do Fat Bottomed Girls!
1196,Hands down.. best reaction I have ever seen!
1197,"How about giving Blackfoot &quot;Train, Train&quot;, Black Sabbath &quot;Paranoid&quot;, Ram Jam &quot;Black Betty&quot; a listen..."
1198,"Duuuuuude that&#39;s an honest react. The range of emotion they conveyed in that song is crazy. And musically, that back-and-forth with the transitions sells it. That&#39;s a great first experience listening to queen."
1199,Dude respect for freedie mercury
1200,It don&#39;t sound like rock xD <br>Wait my man that is one of the greatest guitarists who ever lived and the greatest song ever written
1201,Shaq  you always have me pissing myself laughing
1202,One of Freddie&#39;s biggest idols was Jimi Hendrix and if you had not noticed also the costumes he wore :)
1203,"Freddy Mercury was the lead singer, he was a Lebanese immigrant to the U.K., his family moving there after Muammar Gaddafi took over as dictator of Lebanon, when Freddy was a young child.....Side note: the lead guitarist you see here, Brian May, is a real life genius, his IQ is somewhere north of 170, cuz his other &quot;job&quot; is Astro Physicist, he&#39;s good friends with Neil de Grasse Tyson..."
1204,&quot;What the fuck is going on?!&quot; This is exactly the correct reaction.
1205,"U r rite on with ur analysis...I  started binge watching this weekend..n was gonna subscribe yesterday after ur Bone Thugs n Harmony..but when u went Metal..I was like hell yeah, I havesta  subscribing 4 reals now..better late than never...n keep on opening them chambers"

1207,My entire family has sung this Acapella numerous times. It&#39;s our families thing. My kids have known this song by heart since they were like 5.
1208,FREDDIE MERCURY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would have loved to see them in concert when he was alive!
1209,Freddy Mercury is a god!! This song is legend!!!
1210,You should look up Queens song bicycle
1211,“That keeps coming in and out of each headphone” 😂😂😂😂
1212,I love your reaction
1213,Stuck between wanting to hear the song and not having my ears raped by his voice lmao
1214,"This shows exactly how we humans are. So diverse in our meanings or explanation how or  why this song, a masterpiece btw. is written. All the elements each of the groupmembers own a God given gift to share with people everwhere. This gift is music and words.  They all left us a legacy. Just let it come to you as you like it .     Its just like the bible each of us  interpretend it by their own grounds. Like these other great musicians  the beatles wrote. LET IT BE....."
1215,I gave up. Stop fucking pausing the song.
1216,This made me so happy!! 😁😀
1217,Now go watch Panic at the Disco&#39;s version from the Death of a Bachelor tour.  The ONLY acceptable cover.  It&#39;s epic.
1218,"I think thats the best Reaction ever recorded <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=06m24s"">06:24</a>"

1221,There you go.... Wow... Brrruupphh...<br>How can you say somethin so brutal so nicely<br>You say the meanest thing in the world but sounds like an Angel<br>LMFAO 😂😂😂
1222,"Shaq, you heard this before... surprised about how a lot of people don’t indicate in these reactions comments that the Fugees (Lauryn Hill) did a cover of this song in the 90s or so; I heard it first through them... one of my favorite songs too 🥰"
1223,"They warned you!<br><br>They told you it was a &quot;little different&quot;. Of course, they were all chuckling to themselves at the time."
1224,"Oml , I just got a slap chop add..I am delighted"

1230,Check out their performance of this at live aid. That’s an audience
1231,Were you in the Army?
1232,Freddie Mercury was talking about he had AIDS and was dying and this was kind of his tribute song to his fans in family
1233,That is pure gold song
1234,Rock bands play instruments.  Rap don&#39;t.  Adam lampart took over for him
1235,Hes talking about himself. He was gay and had a hard time telling his mom. Freddy Mercury.
1236,I think this song is about aids
1237,my man deadass ran 😭

1251,"He wrote this song I believe before he died of aids, kind of love johnny cash&#39;s HURT, he knew he was going bye bye and had to say it cryptically. Probably one of the most original arrangements ever. And I&#39;m not a huge queen fan."
1252,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m53s"">6:53</a> - “What the fcuk is going on?” Hahaha"
1253,They are Angel&#39;s
1254,"In 2017, long after Freddie passed away,there was a concert in Hyde Park,London,Green Day Concert. Lots of bands that day. In between band changeovers,the organisers played Bohemian Rhapsody to keep the the music going. They couldn’t have possibly expected the 60,000:crowd to react as they did,in memory of Freddie,the crowd gave their rendition of the song. The love and feeling was immense,check it out,brought a tear to my eye. 👍"

1284,nls: who is this?<br>Freddie: Freddie fucking Mercury
1285,How could anyone not know who this is? It’s an American Anthem 🤔😊
1286,"Rhapsody:<br>Music. an instrumental composition irregular in form and suggestive of improvisation.<br>an ecstatic expression of feeling or enthusiasm.<br>an epic poem, or a part of such a poem, as a book of the Iliad, suitable for recitation at one time.<br>a similar piece of modern literature.<br>an unusually intense or irregular poem or piece of prose.<br><br>&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
1287,"This is what you call real art, 🔥🔥🤘🤘🤘, Queen is definitely on my top 5"
1288,His music is very emotional. It might have something to do with the fact he’s homosexual and he died from AIDS. I believe this was happening during his music career. So the music Queen made has all this wrapped up in it.
1289,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m51s"">6:51</a> &quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot;<br><br>The definition of genius expressed in music form. That is what the fuck is going on."

1313,Bc he&#39;s talking about himself...
1314,This is the song of a man throwing away his closeted life and coming out. The range of emotions you went through...that&#39;s the point.<br>My favorite - &quot;I want to break free&quot;<br>And of course the tongue in cheek I like to ride my bi-cycle ;)
1315,"Of course we wouldn&#39;t warn you.....NOT with Queen!!! Everyone HAS to get THE full experience of them ALL by yourselves!! Lol😋😂❤ @shaq, hun idk if it&#39;s just me, but Queen isn&#39;t a specific genre...their they&#39;re own entity!!! 😀😉🌹😋🙏"

1353,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m50s"">6:50</a> everyone in 2020"
1354,&quot;They sound like angels!&quot; Lmao He was. All of his octaves.
1355,To continue. Freddy would not get the teeth pulled for fear of losing his singing range. If you&#39;ve been to a major sporting event then in all likelihood you have heard We Are The Champions or we will rock you. Both of those are queen. If you really enjoyed this performance then I highly recommend you watch the video of Queens 1985 live parents at Live Aid. Many consider this to be the Pinnacle a live performance. I am thrilled that you have discovered Queen and are exposing your followers to Queen and Freddie Mercury.
1356,"The lead singer of Queen is Freddie Mercury. Most music store Ian&#39;s, certainly all rock music historian, say that Freddie Mercury is the best songwriter they have ever come upon even up to 2020 although she sadly passed away in 91 of AIDS. Freddie Mercury was Leaps and Bounds ahead of his time. The murder he&#39;s referring to is a metaphor for Freddy coming to terms with his sexuality. Even his label did not want to put the song out because they didn&#39;t think anyone would listen, nor any radio station, play a 6-minute song. Also they wanted to know what was the deal with all the Latin and the Opera stuff. Bohemian Rhapsody had a Renaissance when it was featured in Wayne&#39;s World. When the song switches from Opera to True Rock those of us who are head bangers, including myself, just rock out and that&#39;s the scene that you will see in Wayne&#39;s World. I can never get enough of this song. Freddie Mercury had a  For octave singing range. Freddie Mercury&#39;s / bite was due to the fact that he had too many teeth in his mouth."
1357,"Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers.Done in <a href=""http://1965.best/"">1965.Best</a> live version.This is a song you have to do on your channel.Also,I will never fall in love again by Tom Jones."

1411,FREDDY MERCURY SHAQ. He was a once in a generation voice.
1412,It switches headphones because it&#39;s a guy pleading to be freed by a &quot;court&quot; and your stuck in the middle
1413,Freddie Mercury
1414,"He died of aids and the song revolves linda around him facing the truth u dig, my understanding to the song"
1415,My first time watching you. I grew up listening to this and absolutely love your reaction!! Your Mother did a great job . Thank you for opening your mind to new ideas. You are a great example of how we can all find enjoyment in other things.  I believe I will examine some hip hop.  Love you
1416,I love watching your reactions to some of these songs.
1417,"Man, Thank me later. Just watch this. I know you like queen since you heard them. But this is the true proof that they are bigger than life. A concert in 2017 recorded and the freaking WHOLE crowd performs a song almost 30 years old. Imagine bein there. Just write me your honest opinion if you read it shaq. God bless you<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/cZnBNuqqz5g"">https://youtu.be/cZnBNuqqz5g</a>"
1418,Song tells a short story
1419,“Who is this singer?”  Lol!!!!!!!
1420,Bro said Queen&#39;s bipolar lmao 😂😂😂
1421,Dude! Your reactions make my day man. They Bring me so much joy and laughter. Keep on killing it bro&gt;!
1422,Been watching NoLifeShaq for well over a year now. I revisit this reaction from time to time as I know I’m guaranteed a laugh...<br><br>Oh. And so far this is still the only reaction site I have subscribed too... 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
1423,Freddy Mercury is the singer
1424,"“Yo, why didn’t you WARN me?!” Hahahaha!"
1425,This song about him being a Gay man. And him leaving/killing his old self by coming out. When he talked about killing someone just means hkm not hiding his sexuality.
1426,(Lead singer- Fredy Mercury) (guitarist- Bryan May) (Base player- John Deacon) (Roger Taylor- drums)
1427,"Oh, yes they did!"
1428,"When you heard this, did you feel the need to listen to it again? Like you said, a real rollercoaster to the senses."
1429,i don`t believe you haven`t heard this song before that`s almost impossible
1430,You need to react to Fat Bottom Girls and Killer Queen
1431,I know this is late but Shaq can you react to Jamaican Rhapsody by Ronald Reggae. You will end up laughing till the end HAHAHA
1432,This reaction is perfection lol
1433,"Shaq... Bro! Love what you said., How can you say something so brutal but sound like an angel. Lol. Freddy Mercury changed the rock world! Queen made alot of moves and blew us away!"
1434,"Singer, Freddie Mercury. Guitarist, Brian May. Drummer, Roger Tailer, he&#39;s the one that hits the high notes. Basest, John Deeken."
1435,"Love what you do... Love your hat, FEAR THE DEER"
1436,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m17s"">5:17</a> damn we got the next freddie mercury on our hands 😳😳<br><br>Freddie Mercury reincarnated?"
1437,"Im struggling to believe someone has got to his age (in the day of the internet) without having heard this song, or know who Freddy Mercury is."
1438,"😂😂 reaction is quality 😂, pick &amp; mix song top tune 😁👌"
1439,am i trippin or these ni*<b>*</b> sound like angels bro!
1440,Lmao
1441,QUEEN- before you we’re born hmmmm get it Young Blood!
1442,lmao pretending you&#39;ve never heard the song....
1443,Why’s Donovan Mitchell have a Bucks hat on😂
1444,It&#39;s not known whether Freddie knew he had aids when he sang this . But it&#39;s an incredibly powerful song either way and Freddie is sorely missed
1445,This song gets crazy!! The beginning is beautiful and sound so sad and then it gets wild and I love it.❤❤ Innuendo is very very similar and an awesome song
1446,"Freddie Mercury always said the lyrics have no real meaning and was quoted calling them &#39;random rhyming nonsense.&#39;  To me this song is like having the emotional experience of a 2 hour dramatic blockbuster movie condensed into 5 minutes and change.  You have the initial conflict that sets everything in motion, the rising dramatic actions that build tension and excitement, falling actions that let you catch your breath, then more rising that builds to the final climax at the rocking solo.  Climax continues but gives way to the final descent as everything slows down to the finale; which is somber and melodic."
1447,"I now have a new way to describe the song, it goes from &quot;happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick&quot;"
1448,Freddie was a once in a century talent and voice . Queen was my gateway band to everything rock and metal they tried so many genres even reggae
1449,You need to listen the late great Freddie Mercury and appreciate not only his vocals but his overall contribution to Queen. I am not saying the rest did nothing they were just as important and contributed just as much. Their performance at Live Aid 1985 will go down in legend as one of the best live performances of all time as well as being the highlight of that concert
1450,Lead singers name is Freddie Mercury
1451,could he please speak English?
1452,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m08s"">3:08</a>"
1453,Happy Christmas to a Halloween real quick lol
1454,Freddie Mercury I cried when he died
1455,"&quot;a happy christmas, to holloween real quick.&quot; Hahaha"
1456,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=1m37s"">1:37</a> They all sound like angels cuz they’re all separate recordings of Freddie"
1457,I love watching your reaction. You are hilarious. I wish you did more Queen. Maybe &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; or &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;.
1458,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=4m24s"">4:24</a> Freddie Mercury"
1459,Freddie Mercury was a great musician and he wrote most of the songs for Queen. He was the most talented man I&#39;ve ever seen. So sad he died from HIV. If you can find his life story I suggest you watch it.
1460,"The guitar player is Brian May and he is more than a guitar player<br><br>May earned a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007, and was Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 2008 to 2013. He was a &quot;science team collaborator&quot; with NASA&#39;s New Horizons Pluto mission. He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign Asteroid Day."
1461,If you’re ever looking at buying headphones this song is said to be the best ever to play to really see the quality of them. Mix of highs lows bass and treble all through out the song.
1462,"Shaq, you should listen to &quot;innuendo &quot; or &quot;day of our lives&quot;. That&#39;s chilling you to the bone, him knowing he was about to die."
1463,man i think he should react to queen at live aid
1464,Please do the Beatles
1465,your to load brother listen more then comment
1466,"I&#39;ve watched a lot of people react to this song, but your reaction is hands down my favorite. Freddy Mercury was the best!"
1467,OMG I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever laughed so hard and tried to be quiet not to wake the neighbors.  LMAO!!!!
1468,"He&#39;s Freddie Mercury, only a freaking Musical God 😆<br><br>   ... Rip Freddie 💔😿 my idol"

1473,This are the Gangster Bars i ever hear!!!
1474,My man&#39;s got 3 first reactions to Queen
1475,Fun fact the song is a bunch of portions of different songs they wrote that were to short or didn&#39;t fit
1476,You are an absolute ray of sunshine in these dark times- I&#39;m enjoying your reactions immensely!
1477,The world&#39;s very first music video.
1478,"Thanks Shaq. You got me re-appreciating not just my hard rock music, but all music."
1479,I feel like any artist would be so entertained to see Shaq react to their music. It sucks a lot of these artists are dead but somehow I feel like they’d be laughing their asses off too
1480,lmao this whole video was fuckin hilarious RIP freddie 😂
1481,"Brilliant reaction, really went on a journey there... Loved it"
1482,LMAO that is Queeen
1483,Now listen to it over and over and over again ❤
1484,"This is still one of the funniest reviews Iv seen.. Shaq, you crack me up."
1485,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NoLifeShaq"">#NoLifeShaq</a> let&#39;s celebrate your verification with some Queen! Let <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MetalHeadShaq"">#MetalHeadShaq</a> get in on it too. Might I recommend &quot;I Want It All&quot;? It feels appropriate for all you&#39;ve accomplished."
1486,I still cannot believe there are people who hadnt listened Bohemian Rhapsody before in the world... This artwork should be an anthem of the whole world... But anyway! Did anyone sing with Freddie during the video? :’) 🖤 I love you darling👨🏻❣️
1487,Try &quot;Fat bottomed girls!&quot;
1488,It&#39;s so weird seeing someone watch this for the first time. I thought everyone knew about this but I guess not lol
1489,My gf said wat is this song.. now she is my ex.. n now m looking for an assassin.. anyone interested???
1490,“It sound like a Christmas carol .” Best comment ever!
1491,Best song 20 century
1492,"{aka} DJ Whisper ~ I LOVE this reaction lol lol lol....You crack me up watching you on this lol lol....These songs are from my teenage years lol....when we heard them, we were most likely firing up a joint at their concert or half lit in the ass around a camp fire listening lol....It cracks me up seeing the younger generation react to songs from the old folks days when we just thought &quot;Cool man&quot; while we were trippin lol lol Now THIS was and still is MUSIC :) I&#39;ve watched this same reaction about 20 times now lol...I love it that much!  Enjoy"
1493,"Stairway to Heaven will always be the best song ever, but Bohemian Rhapsody is a close second"
1494,"of course you heard it before..... its one of the most known songs in the world, how can you not have heard it before"
1495,Freddie Mercury
1496,&quot;Went from A happy christmas mornin to halloween reaaal quick!&quot; dude im stealin that :P
1497,If you didn&#39;t listen to bohemian rhapsody then you&#39;re ears are still virgin
1498,"Since there is a lot of confusion on what the meaning being the second verse is, I&#39;ll clear it up with what I think it may be. <br><br>Basically, the &#39;just killed a man&#39; is about freddie killing his old personality of being straight and coming out as bisexual/gay. His parents were quite religious in the sense that they may not approve. Freddie saying &#39;it doesn&#39;t really matter&#39; is almost like him saying that he will still be himself no matter what.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this is correct, but this is what (after thinking about the lyrics thoroughly) I have decided as my belief for the meaning of the words. Feel free to tell me what you think, but no hate plz :)"
1499,This is my favourite person on yt now
1500,"Bro your reactions 😂 make my day,keep up the great work"
1501,&quot;They Fu*kin with me right now!&quot; - Shaq.. u da mannn!

1503,Ohh you&#39;ve made my day!
1504,I  love you already.  You are wonderful for listening to a CLASSIC!
1505,This is still the best reaction video ever made
1506,It is not unusual to listen to Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time. It is very unusual not listen to it for the second time.
1507,"First heard this song on my cousin&#39;s mono 45 record player in mid 1970s. Played it over and over but this song was among 100s of other great hit songs one heard on the radio. Now, it&#39;s all forgotten. Oh well."
1508,This song is an emotional blast!
1509,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a> — “D’yall never listen to this with headphones on?1?”<br><br> We invented “Hi-Fi” young man, we invented that shit :)"
1510,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> — “I’m like, ‘Have I heard this before?’”  I just can’t contain my grin :)"

1512,Queen is strong with The Force!
1513,Man you make me laugh all day blessings from sweden ❤️

1515,Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson - There Must Be More to Life Than This (Video Clip) Golden Duet
1516,React to Tribute by Tenacious D
1517,"My son was murdered by police and this song was dedicated to my son,my son was mixed race, and unarmed, my son was a mma fighter dating a cops daughter. He left her and he ended up dead, cops got away with it."
1518,I kind forgot what the Silhouetto meant. I think it meant that he’s his old self or something like that
1519,"True meaning about just killed a man, was explained by a lady that knew him. And she said by killed a man he means a killed himself that was hiding his sexuality, but now he’s free from hiding is more or less gay."
1520,WTF is going on he says ROTFLMAO
1521,Freddy Mercury
1522,"good for you broadening your horizons musically. theres so much good music out there that most people don&#39;t give a chance to because its not their typical sound. you can find at least a few songs from any genre that make you feel nd that you can vibe or relate to, and Queens definitely legendary for a reason, never will there be another voice like Freddie, definitely check out more of their catalogue, you don&#39;t have vibes in your soul if you cant vibe to Queen lmfao"
1523,What do your two doors leed two?
1524,Anyone tell him this was done without auto-tune?
1525,I&#39;m out here dyin laughin from Crazytown USA 2020

1528,Mate this reaction is just outstanding 🤣🤣
1529,Probably the Best song of all time!
1530,Some say this is the greatest song ever. Thanks for reacting.
1531,"Not to sound like an old person but you really don&#39;t get music like this anymore, although a lot of drugs went into their production"
1532,Waynes World!
1533,lol best reaction
1534,Freddie Mercury
1535,Imagine bein the dumbass who didn&#39;t want to release this song cause it was &quot;too long of gibberish&quot;
1536,"Hahaha!!!!! All my black friends in college I’d play that song  they all disrespected me!! Didn’t have YouTube or videos on the the phone back then! Love the videos and you are super open to all shit! That’s why I watch you! No racism, nothing! We laugh and enjoy together. We appreciate you here in Iowa dude!!!!!!!!!"
1537,"Whales be like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m12s"">3:12</a>"
1538,This is a really great song that I&#39;ve heard way too many times.  It must be fun for people who haven&#39;t really listened to it.
1539,if you have never heard this before you must be living in a cave
1540,You are brilliant. Love your reactions.
1541,"oh for petes sake, too much interuption-outta here"

1544,"You seriously need to see queen&#39;s set at live aid, 20 minutes well earned, of Freddie Mercury with 60,000 people in the palm of his hand.. Check it out sausage, <br>sending love from Hampshire, England  xzz"
1545,Who else thinks of Wayne’s World when hearing this song?
1546,"nobody: <br>niggas in 1975: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m52s"">6:52</a>"
1547,Imagine of not having heard Queen before and imagine not having heard of Freddie Mercury wich is one of the greatest singer off all time if not the greatest.
1548,"is this fake, i am from Serbia and i know this song"
1549,If you&#39;re in for some more surprising music you wouldn&#39;t ever listen to if you only listen to hip hop: I highly suggest you try &#39;Floor Jansen and Henk Poort singing Phantom of the Opera. The vocals on this are amazing. Since you like the vocals on this song I think you can appreciate that!
1550,"Stop stopping song, just listen then talk"
1551,How in the hell do you not know who Freddie Mercury is
1552,I was about to say if he has never heard this song he has been living under a rock
1553,"Please do Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance, it’s an emotional roller coaster"

1564,I&#39;ve always said the world was a better place with Freddy Mercury in it. RIP Freddy.. 😭
1565,For the sake of knowledge.....this genre is known as “Rock Opera”.
1566,"Queen...<br><br>Is one of the most diverse groups there ever has been...<br><br>Freddie Mercury has amazing vocals<br><br>Brian May, is an AMAZING guitarist (AND ASTROPHYSICIST!)<br><br>John Deacon has some of the most ICONIC bass riffs known to man!<br><br>Roger Taylor is an OUTSTANDING drummer... the chemistry was there <br><br>If any of them were missing... they wouldn&#39;t have been the greatest rock band in history..."
1567,"NOLIFESHAQ you gotta check out the reggae version of this song. It&#39;s super dope and goes along as both a parody of song and video. I&#39;m curious to see your reaction. Keep making fire videos man, ima keep stayin up wit you. The video is by Ronald Reggae called Jamacian Rhapsody."
1568,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m44s"">7:44</a> priceless 😂😂😂"

1592,"Welcome to the legend known as Freddie Mercury and Queen.  What other rock band goes from a ballad to opera to hard rock and back to the ballad?  None.  Freddie and Queen aren&#39;t bipolar (LOL!!), they were simply the very best of the best."
1593,"By the way, this 57 yr old grandmother thinks you&#39;re funny as shi*.....Missing my family in SC..Do you live there?"
1594,"Call your momma and tell her you love her. You don&#39;t ever need an excuse. One day she&#39;ll be gone, like mine..Any way the wind blows..."

1598,Absolutely loving your reaction videos bro! Keep it up!

1612,"Aw this was funny actually 😄<br>And yeah I love how soft and gentle young Freddie Mercury sings and how epic and cool he sings in his late 30s and 40s. I just love this difference, when you have a certain mood you can listen to a Queen&#39;s certain song just because Freddie sings a little bit different in each of these songs, but he always sings so great."
1613,the album is called a night at the opera!! get it???
1614,Freddy mercury man!!!  how you not know who he is??? lol!! he&#39;s known for having one of the highest octave singing voices ever!! the 2nd! behind rob Hoffer of judest prest.

1630,You were missing out!  They are fucking amazing! Freddy Mercury....one of the best ever!

1632,"If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, watch the movie.... it will explain the reason for the changes in the music in this song. Pretty awesome!"
1633,"Boyyy, react to Kiss"
1634,"Freddie Mercury actually sang all the vocals to the intro. His band didn&#39;t sing that part even though it appears that they are. He sang all those parts. This is a genius song.  (If you haven&#39;t done it yet, I recommend Meatloaf Two out of Three ain&#39;t bad as a good one to do. The first time I heard that I had to do a double take.)"

1685,"&quot;An emotional rollercoaster ...&quot; exactly - the song is a journey, and Freddie is controlling our emotions.  I love how you said they go from angels to halloween - right before the devil set aside for me.  You get it.  All those times you changed the channel in your past - you just weren&#39;t ready yet."
1686,Actually the first harmony was recorded and done by Freddie alone even though the MV shows like they sing it together
1687,"I just wish he knew the theme of the song is about a man that has made mistakes and is being torn between the good he thinks is inside him versus the evil of the actions he has done. It puts this song into perspective with regards to the changes in melody, key, and beat."
1688,Love this dude. Knows how to feel and experience music
1689,Bro you gotta check out within temptation. Some of the best rock/opera rock

1696,It is not really about him shooting someone but about him coming out to his parents saying he killed the person that they thought he was and time for them to know the truth about his life
1697,SHAQ U HAVE TO WATCH THE RASTA VERSION OF THAT SONG
1698,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m12s"">3:12</a> he reacted like everyone reacts to a freestyle battle"

1710,you should watch the movie Bohemian Rhapsody and you will understand this song
1711,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m10s"">3:10</a> instant heart attack for headphone users!"

1715,As a musical group they were way ahead of their time.
1716,"Queen was awesome.  Just as whites can get a lot from black music,  blacks can get a lot from white music., if they can just get beyond  their prejudices."
1717,Bohemian Rhapsody was a song about his coming out as gay. It also spoke of the relationship that lead to his Diagnoses of AIDS/HIV. It told of his emotions and thoughts going through him at the time.
1718,"Queen: One of my favorite bands, great band, good job on the reaction!"

1722,The poor guy died of AIDS I think he knew we had it when he made the song I don&#39;t know what are you friends think IDK or maybe they didn&#39;t know about age back then he probably thought he had an anemic disease like Gia the movie IDK what do you think
1723,"How could this be one of my favorite songs it has my name in it love Mia Mama Mia Mama Mia let me go, never LMFAO"
1724,Freddy I forgot his last name but he died of AIDS a long time ago poem and he got great great music his music is hurting every stadium and every game you ever want in your life and people don&#39;t even know it
1725,Did u really just pause between the guitar solo!

1752,"<b>&quot;Mama, oooohhhh&quot;</b><br><br>Shaq: <b>oHOoHoHo</b>"
1753,I think you had the reaction Queen was looking for when they wrote this song. I think they wanted the listener to feel a gamut of emotions as the song takes then on a journey.
1754,"If you want to see what this music is really about, what impact really had on people check Green Day - Bohemian Rhapsody in Hyde Park.<br>It will give another dimension to what you&#39;ve heard.<br>Keep it up!"
1755,Me: goddamn that was an emotional rollercoaster<br>Him: that was a rollercoaster 😂😂😂

1787,"This is probably my favourite ever reaction to Bohemian Rhapsody. It&#39;s pure, it&#39;s a little shocked, it&#39;s earnest and it&#39;s beautiful. It&#39;s a brilliant reminder to kids who are bullied every day, as I was, for being LGBT+. Freddie Mercury was LGBT+ and is still one of the most admired people of all time, purely for his ability and talent and regardless of his sexuality <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BeOpen"">#BeOpen</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BeKind"">#BeKind</a>"

1790,You have no idea what that song was all about it was not just one song He combined three songs. Bohemian Rhapsody when is first came out as the featured song it did not go over well but after a while. Long it became number one. You have to understand Freddie Mercury and you cannot judge him just on this song this was a fabulous song Freddie Mercury wasn&#39;t just any kind of singer he was a performer. You have to hear more other songs than just this one to even get a close understanding of what Freddie Mercury in the band Queen were all about. Don&#39;t judge by one song
1791,The singer is Freddie Mercury the band is Queen he is there lead performer not just a singer performer

1878,"fuck off, AS IF you never heard bohemian rhapsody"
1879,"If I&#39;m not mistaken, Freddie did all the vocals via over dubbing.  Roger Taylor, the drummer, sang the high notes......Unreal talent in that band!"

1887,Freddy a real g to say he took life and didnt even bat a lash
1888,I don&#39;t like so much pausing especially to legendary songs like this one.  But you&#39;re the one reacting I understand. Not trying to be mean but it gets kinda annoying at times with too much pausing.

1901,"I&#39;ve heard this song countless times, and legitimately still got shivers listening again. Might be the greatest song ever written"
1902,"It’s interesting to note that pretty much NOTHING sounded like this song at the time. This was the era of the big stadium bands: KISS, Led Zep, Kansas, Boston, STYX, etc....the thought of combining Opera &amp; Rock n Roll was unheard of. Freddie Mercury is the lead singer. One of the best singers ever!"

1911,Audioslave- Like A Stone is amazing and I really think you&#39;d enjoy listening to it since you seem to pay attention to the lyrics to all your rock reactions. The lead singer has a great (non-screamy) voice.

1931,I wonder if you went to see the movie Bohemian Rhapsody after reacting to this
1932,"I’m a <b>HUGE</b> Queen fan, so I appreciate you taking the time to listen to them. I’m sure you know by now that the main singer was Freddie Mercury, who died of AIDS in 1991 when he was 45. By the time he confirmed he had AIDS (he held a press conference), he literally died the very next day.  😔<br>Btw, now you should go watch the Movie Bohemian Rhapsody."

1966,"Shaq you should react to Venom, &quot;Warhead&quot;..."

2000,Greatest frontman of all time
2001,whats amazing about this song and Shaq&#39;s reaction is that was a 6 and a half minute song and he didn&#39;t even realize it.  Twice the run time of most songs.

2057,"The whole idea is to set up the song like an opera, which tells a story in different songs and ends in climax either resolving the conflict or not. It is musical rock brilliance, this song. Will live on for generations to come."
2058,"If you haven&#39;t figured out by the lyrics &quot; Mama, Just Killed a Man &quot; its a song, that is a letter from a son to a mother, like a dairy of what happened to the son to the point of the court case and he fails the case and gets to rot in jail for life as it is seemed to him &quot; Wanting to Get outta here &quot;  the final... &#39; bridge &#39; Is supposed that he took something or hung himself as he litterly to the point of ever gettting out and just giving up on life...... as &quot; Nothing really matters to me &quot; and the final line &quot; Any way the wind blows &quot; there is a reason why that last note of that line is so deep........ its supposed to mean when he &quot; died &quot; or his heart gave out, the line itself is maybe a Nursery Rhyme or some song the &quot; son &quot; was told from his mom and his last thought being his mom as in the while song sounding like a Sucide note/Letter/Poem of how a Son Shot a Man and he freaks out and tells his mom through said way..... its the way I look on it.... and you&#39;ve earned my Sub Homie coming from a person who loves any genre of music really besides Opera ( cept one song from a movie ) and some Classical..... I prefer my 60-80&#39;s Rock, like Queen, The Police ( Stings Band, &quot; Every Breath you Take &quot; was their most popular ), ect. :D"
2059,"Damn. Shaq, your reactions are the best. You&#39;re the real thing. I&#39;m cryin laughing so hard 😂😂😂😂"

2072,"1st part: a man has commmited homicide and will be put to death, so he&#39;s saying goodbye to his crying mother, whose whipping is represented by the guitar solo.<br><br>2nd: &quot;I see a little silhouette...&quot; the man is at the Gates of Hell (Thunderbolt and Lightning... )but he&#39;s still fighting, along with his mother&#39;s prayers for salvation: &quot;I&#39;m just a poor boy, nobody loves me / He&#39;s just a poor boy from a poor family, spare his life from this monstruosity&quot; <br><br>3rd: &quot;Bismillah!&quot; means &quot;In the Name of God&quot;, which marks the entry of angels and begins the battle for this poor soul: &quot;We will not let you go / Let him go! Bismillah!...&quot; <br><br>4th: &quot;So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?&quot; The demons are angry and losing, and he&#39;s &quot;just gonna get outta here&quot;. Angels win the battle and the man is forgiven."
2073,Brings me back to the 4th grade and hearing this from my brother who was 12...so awsome to have an older brother to hear good rock..

2079,Dude Freddie had like 4 extra teeth which made his resonance and pitch different than most and he was one of the only ones to have the range he could range just over 3 octaves!!! He was AMAZING!!
2080,subscribed because Shaq asks the question everyone wonders during the opera section but nobody wants to pause the song to ask<br><br><br><br>what the fuck is going on...?

2092,I could watch this guy all day. Just reacting you random shit like a spork
2093,I can&#39;t think of a time when I didn&#39;t know of the existence of this song I cannot remember the first time I heard it and it just kind of flowed over me like oh yeah this is a weird rock song I didn&#39;t pay attention to the words I know we all found the Opera part amusing but what I wouldn&#39;t give to be an adult and hear this for the first time some of these lyrics are so unbelievably heavy &quot;sometimes wish I&#39;d never been born at all&quot; the first time I actually paid attention to the lyrics I was crying after hearing it for the millionth time. It&#39;s like Wesley Snipes was saying and White Men Can&#39;t Jump you can listen to the lyrics but you don&#39;t hear the lyrics
2094,The modern day version of this is Green Day-Jesus of Suburbia
2095,how tf have you not heard this song before 🤦🏼‍♂️

2109,it s the best song ever
2110,This reaction made my day.
2111,Fuck you are annoying
2112,The whole point of this song is for it to be like a mini play in the form of a song
2113,You need to see the movie!
2114,"Around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a> when you said no fucking way to that high note, that is not actually the lead singer on the album, that would be their guitarist, who is almost, somehow nearly as talented and could sing higher, however Freddy did make him do 1000 takes and diff version"
2115,Singer: Freddie Fuckn Mercury <br>Bass:John Dekan  <br>Guitar:Brian May<br>Drums: Roger Taylor

2121,"Freddie Mercury dead at 45 from complications of AIDS, Bohemian Rhapsody isn&#39;t a song; it&#39;s an experience in pop rock opera classical! You reacted just right!"
2122,"When he talks about pulling the trigger and shooting someone in the head its a reference to his transition from the old Freddie to the new Freddie, he killed the old Freddie."
2123,"It is bipolar. Because of a the song is about his bisexuality, his conservative upbringing and his sexual awakening. He is getting pulled in every direction and he captured it so well in this song. <br>Freddy&#39;s vocals expression kills yeah."
2124,It’s absolute musical genius. The transitions just flowed flawlessly. The vocals amazing song
2125,Brian May one of the best guitarist ever I seen him twice he opened up for guns and roses in the state of Maine
2126,EVERYBODY HURTS BY R.E.M.
2127,UNER PRESSUJRE BY QUEEN AND DAVID BOWIE

2130,bro I love you so much cus you can understand other genres and have respect for them
2131,I hope you have expanded your musical horizons since this.
2132,"Maybe I&#39;m just slow, or my tired brain is making odd connections, but the lyrics sound like every young person who f**ked up, joined a gang, and knew they were going to prison. <br><i>&#39;Mama, just killed a man. Put my gun against his head; pulled my trigger, now he&#39;s dead. Mama, life had just begun..and now I&#39;ve gone and thrown it all away.&#39;</i> <br>Life, death, regret, wishing he hadn&#39;t made his mother cry... I never realized that the lyrics were such a mirror to modern gang violence and the school-to-prison pipeline. Or maybe I&#39;m reading too much into it."
2133,"Freddy Mercury, and yes this man could sing his ass off"
2134,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m03s"">3:03</a>. When you hear a song but don&#39;t listen to it LOL"
2135,You need to do some pink Floyd I suggest comfortably numb of wish you were here
2136,Queen is an all-time favorite!!!
2137,It’s mad because I’m from England it’s impossible not to hear this song 1000 times before your even 1😂
2138,Somebody send this Brian May or Rogar Taylor
2139,1974-1975
2140,"For your own gratification; Watch their performance at Live Aid Wembley Stadium. It&#39;s considered by many as the best live performance of all time.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkFHYODzRTs"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkFHYODzRTs</a>"
2141,Freddy mercury is a god
2142,Freddy Mercury is his name
2143,This song was at number 1 in the UK singles chart for 9 weeks in 1975.
2144,Queen had alot of great hits you’ve probably heard and didn’t know it was them. “We are the Champions”
2145,he is freddie mercury darling
2146,This song doesn’t have a set meaning but it can be related to the hardships of Freddie’s life
2147,"If you want to understand this song, listen to it three more times without interruption. The first time is to get the flow, the nest three times to get the meaning, if you are lucky."
2148,The song actually has a very deep meaning that most people dont know... This song is actually a confession by Freddie Mercury ( the lead singer) to the world that he&#39;s Gay and its a story of how he had to hide if from his parents and the society because in his religion.. Being Gay wasnt accepted... You should really see videos explaining Bohemian Rhapsody... You will know why is this song such a hit
2149,Listen to it again knowing the lead singer wrote this right after learning he had AIDS. It makes a LOT more sense.
2150,The lead singer for queen was Freddie Mercury
2151,"Queen was fucking incredible in concerts, at least that’s what dad told me"
2152,Yo shaq u need to watch the Wayne&#39;s World version of this song in video form from the movie
2153,His name is Freddy Mercury and you should do the epic rap battle of him vs Frank Sinatra
2154,"LMFAO,&quot; feel like a punk and a gangster&quot;"
2155,Brother a have to ride this train with you.
2156,😂😅😎
2157,Welcome to a new world of music
2158,Freddie Mercury is the greatest singer ever lived on earth.. hands down
2159,"Seriously, you need to listen to the whole song through WITHOUT PAUSING!!"
2160,You paused in the middle of a Brian May solo!!!  Sacrilege!!
2161,Also - the “shooting a man in the head” lyrics are figurative.
2162,Hey - where are you from?  Your accent is awesome!!
2163,He just called Freddie a “nigga”!!!  And... I bet Freddie would be just fine with that!  Shaq.  You are AWESOME!  Love your videos!

2169,"Ha ha ha ha ha, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON,  brilliant reaction."
2170,hes freddie mercury
2171,Freddy had a 5 octive range and could switch from one to the other effortlessly.  He was a true God among mortals....you should listen to his Opera recordings.  <br><br>The world still mourns his passingy 😢
2172,To much talk nigga.... damn
2173,This is such a shit lie.<br>There is absolutely no way a person who literally runs a YouTube channel dedicated to music reactions has never heard of Bohemian Rhapsody.<br><br>It&#39;s literally impossible unless you&#39;re deaf. This cash grab for views is so fucking stupid.
2174,This is the greatest reaction I&#39;ve ever seen!
2175,Its like rock opera 😂
2176,{aka} DJ Whisper...The singer of Queen&#39;s name is Freddie Mercury.  He died of bronchopneumonia resulting from AIDS at the age of 45 . Another great song to react to is &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;
2177,Has this guy never really heard bohemian rhapsody before
2178,Freddy Mercury a legend
2179,"He really should see the &quot;The Story of Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; {<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP5_cnKuo3A}"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP5_cnKuo3A}</a>  about the making of the song."
2180,"Oh man, Shaq, you have to react to The Beach Boys - Good Vibrations!!! Serious."
2181,“I feel like a punk and a gangsta!”👍🏾
2182,"THE Freddie Mercury, King of Queen. Long live the King.<br>The first true rock opera! <br>Perfect pitch, perfect tones, perfect enunciation, ...and ALL before accutune! The overdubbing required to get all their voices down all but wore out the tape!<br>It was really something special if you and your friends learned and really knew ALL the words (and parts) and could then sing them together in a car or on the bus! It would REALLY get the vehicle rocking and put smiles on faces, ...including those beside you at stop lights!"
2183,I from Brasil brother....Queen all music fantástic ...you hear...dont stop me now..very fanny...😂😂😂...👏👏👏🖒🤘
2184,Im a long time metal and rock bassist. Your reaction videos make me so fucking happy! Like I can&#39;t stop watching.
2185,"Freddy Mercury, one of the best singers of all time."

2187,Summer of 1980 I saw Queen.  To this day it remains one of my top concert experiences.
2188,This is the best reaction channel ever. Ever.
2189,bro u pause to much
2190,Welcome to the greates rock song of all time. You&#39;re welcome.
2191,He need to react to tame impala
2192,I believe he wrote this song about him finding out he had aids
2193,"Best reaction ever, I&#39;m dead 😂😂"
2194,Said it before but this guy will make a shit day better.
2195,Its an emotional rollercoaster.... DARRLIING! Freddie Mercury still touches all of us as if its all brand new and just for a moment time stands still to embrace it then sadly reminded how long he has been gone and my heart aches...that is the rollercoaster I gladly take the front seat to re-live it! Watching you thru this made it as if it just came on the radio thru your eyes! Thank you for that experience!💕
2196,"&quot;I don&#39;t care what you do with my music, just don&#39;t make it boring.&quot; RIP Freddie Murcury"
2197,"Your reaction is so inosent , raw and undiluted.  Glad that you have opened up your appreciation of different music genre . Black folks (I&#39;m one ) tend to be very predictable in their music taste."
2198,The funniest vid I have seen in ages 😂😂
2199,"WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON<br><br>Lmao, yep."
2200,Original sicko mode
2201,It&#39;s a story about life. He makes a mistake. Tries to get out of it. Goes to prison. Gets mad. And gets over it.
2202,Please tell me you&#39;ve heard Queen&#39;s &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;. If not...you&#39;ll love it
2203,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m17s"">5:17</a>😭😭😭😂😂😂"
2204,"freddie is a gay god, lucky to have him"
2205,"The singer is Freddie Mercury, who played like six different instruments and had an eight octave vocal range. This song was, I believe, the last one he ever wrote before he died of AIDS. It was written as a good-bye to his band members and fans."
2206,You need to do more of the 80s greats!
2207,Bro he is a genius watch the bohemian rhapsody movie and tell me what you think...
2208,should watch and react to the wanyes world version of this song ... that would be funny as .... :)
2209,I love this reaction.. ❤
2210,Freddie mercury took 3 songs and put them together to make this beautiful art
2211,"Hi Shaq! Been subscribing your channel for a long time now, and thanks for all the great experiences you&#39;ve given. So now I want to give you a real good time back!  If you want to get maybe your biggest musical enlightening ever, when it comes to vocals and soul, I suggest you listen to ANGELINA JORDAN, she won Norway got talent in 2014, at the age of 7!!! Now she&#39;s participating in America got talent- Champions edition, where she already has been given the Golden Buzzer(!) For her version of Bohemian Rapsody, by Queen. When listening to her singing, it&#39;s mindboggling to even try to comprehend that what you hear is from a 13 year old girl, ENJOY! :)"
2212,I have to rate this reaction better than his Free Bird reaction. He literally doesnt know how to react!
2213,What the f*** is going on?! LOLOLOL
2214,You&#39;re the truth son!!
2215,"Listen to the lyrics, and feel the atmosphere. <br>A kid gets into some shit, goes wrong in life, and kills a man. He gets caught, feels bad for hurting his family, and goes to court. <br>That&#39;s where all the back and forth &quot;will you let me go,&quot; &quot;Bismillah, we will not let you go!&quot; comes from, it&#39;s him vs the state, with his friends and family begging the court to have mercy. <br>He gets stuck in jail, and after a whole lot of initial resistance, and his friends and family losing touch as the years go by, he eventually loses hope and accepts his fate. <br>It&#39;s a bitchin&#39; tune, but kinda depressing."
2216,bro you seriously out here telling people you never heard bohemian rhapsody before? get the fuck outta here. how is such an obvious lie not downvoted more? jesus.
2217,"That was Freddy fucking Mercury. He didn&#39;t leave a mark on history, he french kissed it."
2218,Rip Freddie Mercury
2219,Do something by the doors please
2220,Can you react to Somebody to love and Somebody to like like in Montreux live in 81
2221,"The lead singer is Freddie Mercury he worked at an airport , the guitarist is Brian May PhD in Astrophysics, the drummer is Roger Taylor and studied dentistry, and the Bass guitarist is John Deacon and studied Engineering.  They came together to form Queen in the early 70s."
2222,When you know why he wrote this song you feel it so much more and If im correct he&#39;s talking about himself in this song when he said mamma I&#39;ve just killed a man it was because he actually contracted HIV and thats why he also said i don&#39;t want to die sometimes i wish I&#39;d never been born at all and plus more....listen to the song once you know the true meaning behind it
2223,"You just weren&#39;t ready my bro, This is the music I grew up with til I was allowed to select my own choices round 15yrs old. Obviously being a brown fulla I jumped on hip hop, but I was lucky in the sense that I already had ears for correct barz. Blessings in disguise I guess"

2236,To anyone new understand all the overlapping effects were from doing hundreds of takes and pasting them as Freddy wanted them..... Understand 9 minute rock songs with OPERA in them were like ........... to most radio stations as they would be today..... Yes that is how trail blazing Queen and Freddy were.  Greatness never expires.  Glad to see the younger gen get in touch with their music.

2323,"There&#39;s a whole lot of history behind this song.<br><br><br>While nowadays this song is very well knowed amongst rock fans and evne those that arn&#39;t particularly rock fans, and is viewed something like a Rock Anthem, at the release it was really the case.<br><br><br>The title was so out there, experimental and bizzare that for the mainstream medias and people, they just din&#39;t like it, only the bands fans and rocks fans in general liked the song.<br>(EDIT; There&#39;s a distinction between Mainstream public/normies AND Rock fans, the song was popular amongst Rock fans, but it was only top 10 in the US at release, while when the movie came out it was top 2 in the US)<br><br><br>So the song became somwhat ignored and forgotten outside die hard fans for a good decade or two.<br>(Edit; ignored and forgottten, was a bit of a strong statement, but it is facts that it wasn&#39;t a song that was aired on radios for a long arse while, until the movie came out, so more like discreet?, and once again i&#39;m talking about Mainstream Radios and Media, not Rock specialised media or Rock fans)<br><br><br>Now flash forward to the mid 90&#39;s, with the release of the Movie, Wayne&#39;s World.<br><br><br>Wayne&#39;s world is all about 2 best bros who&#39;re rock heads and they have a pirate Radio/tv show where they talk about music, concerts etc, they are the definition of stoner/looser guys , but that are adorable, dorky and just nice guys, its a great piece of comedy gold.<br><br><br>Wayne played by Mike Meyers, in the opening scene of the movie, says &quot;lets put the greatest song of all times on&quot; and they put on Bohemian Rhapsody in the car and it plays during the intro of the movie.<br><br><br>Now its important to now that the song was imposed by Meyers, since in the script it was another song that was supposed to be played, Stairway to Heaven iirc.<br>(EDIT; it was not staorway to heaven, but a Guns &#39;n Roses song, supposed to be used in the intro sequence, i got it mixed with the scene in the instrument shop, with the sign &quot;No Stairway to heavens!&quot;)<br><br><br>Meyers said NOPE, the best Rock song is Bohemian Rhapsody, so they went with it.<br><br><br>And at the release of the movie in theatres, since the song was widely unknown to a large portion of the 90&#39;s kids generation, they all loved it and they went in disc shops to buy the cd&#39;s/vynils.<br><br><br>So that one scene in a movie 15 years later after the song was released, gave a new life to the song, and it made the band popular again in the US, and since then Bohemian Rhapsody is tagged as the Best Rock song on Earth.<br><br><br>Freddie Mercury saw the movie and he loved it, can&#39;t remember if he was allready sick of AIDS at the time or not though, but Brian May who was contacted by Meyers to ask them if they could use it, then said that Freddie was smilling and laughing all along the scene.<br>(EDIT; While Freddy died from Pneumonia due to the Aids, the 24 Nov of 91 and the movie released in Feb 14, 92, people seems to forget that a movie is always finished MONTHS before the release, and Brian may in an ITW said it himself that Mayers reached out to him, and Brian forwarded the movie to Freddy who was not in the best shape at the time, and he liked the movie.<br>Here&#39;s the ITW link:<br><br><a href=""https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/brian-may-wayne-s-world-bohemian-rhapsody-scene-hit-close-home"">https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/brian-may-wayne-s-world-bohemian-rhapsody-scene-hit-close-home</a> )<br><br><br>Now double trivia and another fast forward, in the recent movie Bohemian Rhapsody, when the producer who&#39;s played by Mike Meyers, tells the band &quot;No youth is gonna head bang to this song in their car!!&quot;, its a call back/easter egg at Wayne&#39;s World scene where they&#39;re a bunch of youth headbanging in their car on this song...<br><br><br>The circle is complete"
2324,"Do you know why he said,&quot;I don&#39;t wanna die, I sometimes wish I&#39;ve never been born at all&quot;? Cause he had AIDS but he&#39;s so top on music on that era that he wish that he could either have not born in the first place or he fully live his life which he could not really do."
2325,subs..hello there! american mum sent me here ...
2326,Lmfao  Love the reaction
2327,"Freddy had such a tragic life, he was born into a traditional family that did not approve of his singing career at all, and disowned him for a while. Married a woman named Mary Austin. Then when the media found out he was gay they treated him poorly (this was the 70&#39;s- early 90&#39;s, (he died in 1991), and made it worse for him and his family... He wouldn&#39;t even do interviews after that for being hounded on his sexuality and rumors of HIV. He was diagnosed with AIDS and didn&#39;t confirm it publicly until two days before he died, because he was so ashamed due to the public. He left a few grand to his lover because he also positive, so Freddy thought he would die soon... Shortly after Freddie died they found curative methods for HIV and AIDS (too late 😢)... So his lover lived on for decades and moved to Ireland. Freddy left half of his muli-million $$ estate to his first love (His only wife) whom they divorced but remained best friends/family, he considered her his soulmate despite being gay. It&#39;s sad he&#39;s being remembered and loved now more than ever, now that he&#39;s gone, but that&#39;s usually how it goes with brilliant legends. If I could meet a handful of people from the past, he would be one of them. He was a beautiful and kind, romantic soul with a big heart that helped many.<br>Edit - He truly was an &#39;Angel&#39; as he said 😊😇"
2328,Hus name waa FREDDY MERCURY. I love this song. It still blows me away!!! Keep staying yourself and kick back and listen to awesome music.

He played the guy who refused to allow Queen to make their single ”Bohemian Rhapsodyl, and he sure regretted that decision. <br><br>Last thing, you will also recognize Mike Myers who was the star in EVERY ”Austin Powers” movie. In those movies he played of course ”Austin Powers”, ”Fat Bastard”, ”Dr. Evil” and ”Goldmember”. He also at one point from 1999-2011 was on ”Saturday Night Live”.

2425,"This is the first video of your&#39;s I&#39;ve seen but I&#39;ve been watching Queen reaction videos lately.  If you haven&#39;t seen it, watch the Queen Days of Our Lives documentary on Youtube.  I think what Queen did was write what their fans (back then all the way to now) cared about.  They sang about the stuff we don&#39;t normally talk to our friends about.  I&#39;ve never told one of my friends that I wish I had never been born but I&#39;ve thought it often enough.  They let us know that they&#39;ve been there too.  I&#39;ll be watching more of your videos.  :)"
2426,I would be laughing hard with you.

2773,Did you really ask who Freddie Mercury was?
2774,The singer is Freddy Mercury.
2775,"Queen is amazing, if you enjoy their music I really recommend giving the movie a watch &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; - It will explain a wholllleeeeee lot."
2776,You are simply awesome Shaq. ❤️. I found your channel yesterday and can&#39;t stop watching. You&#39;ve got a fan for life ❤️

2781,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m21s"">3:21</a> How can someone say something so brutal so nicely? <b>He&#39;s talking to his Mama.</b> 😂"
2782,This guy is my new favorite. Play on Playa. You’re entertaining AF.

2792,Do Hocus Pocus by Focus
2793,Who is this man omg I’m kicking off wooooowwwwww
2794,this song is so damn tight!!!! I love it
2795,"The song is a metaphor. What that metaphor is depends on who is asking. Some believe that it is about Freddie Mercury dealing with his homosexuality. The &quot;Momma, just killed a man&quot; part is about him killing his old self he pretended to be to become the openly gay man that he is, but the later part about &quot;Wish I never been born at all&quot; is about regretting that decision and because being gay was so taboo at the time."
2796,Hey Freddie what genre of music you want?Freddie: yes.
2797,"Bro when he said, “who is this singer” it hurt my soul. Freddie Mercury the goat."
2798,Im RAGING ON THIS SIDE AND CRYING ON THE OTHER LMAO
2799,Freddie The Main Man Mercury
2800,When queen wrote this they recorded it so it would go between speakers at that time.
2801,"its influence was OPERA...just saying...and yes, it&#39;s an emotional roller coaster."
2802,It&#39;s amazing watching someone learn how much sadness and loneliness means to rock and roll.
2803,I swear like 75% of my youtube holes end up with me searching for live videos of Freddie Mercury. That fucking voice.
2804,Love this guy and his reaction!!
2805,The one and only Freddie Mercury
2806,Elton john next

2815,Freddy Mercury was the best voice in rock. We lost him in the early 90s ☹️ RIP Freddy
2816,One of the most magically pieces of music in all of human history. God fucking damn it evokes so much emotion.
2817,"Now that you&#39;ve seen the original, you&#39;ve got to hear the Muppets version. 😉"
2818,That singer is Freddie Mercury. He&#39;s one of the best front-men in all of rock n&#39; roll. He&#39;s the rock star other rock stars want to be when they grow up.
2819,This shit has me in tears! You got yourself a subscriber my man.
2820,This was hilarious!! 😂😂 “WTF IS GOING ON” 😂

2825,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m10s"">6:10</a> (til the end)<br>baby, this is what you came for"
2826,"Freddie Mercury his name is Freddie Mercury. He is a Rock legend. Love him, miss him."
2827,He talking about dying from aids
2828,"Lolz. Just let you know if you listen to the lyrics he tells a story. There are 2 interpretations one he is coming out of the closet. The other he shot a mob leader and is running for his life, he calls his mom to tell he will die and on the run. the police and the mob tries to find him. Police gets to him first and sides with him. While the mob comes there was a gun fight (thunder bolt and lighting). he survived with the police now on trial pleading for self defense but loses the case and get sentenced. Now he tries to escapes. and it doesn’t really matter anymore because he lost everything and can’t see as a escape convict."
2829,"You need to check out more of the songs from Queen , they are phenomenal"
2830,His name is freddie mercury
2831,I feel like Freddie Mercury would appreciate this commentary
2832,Thats Freddy Mercury bru

2834,“These niggas sound like angels.” 🤣 Love it
2835,Can we get some Meatloaf reactions up in here?
2836,"Shaq I just happened to come across your channel and became a fan real quick. I&#39;m glad you opened your horizons, music is a beautiful thing.  QUEEN to me was the best rock band ever! And Freddie&#39;s voice/sound was absolutely perfect. Keep those vids commin."

2842,&quot; I don&#39;t know if I want to throw my phone at my momma or call my momma&quot;......LOL LOL Lol
2843,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m50s"">6:50</a> ,The rock opera part of the song ,and your reaction &quot;WTF is going on&quot;.  I&#39;m crying  / laughing. Your face says it all."
2844,Freddy Mercury had a great voice. May he R.I.P.  I should listen to him more often. Your reactions are what keep me coming back to your channel. Love it.
2845,"Queen , gift to humanity from some higher power."

2850,You got to watch the movie it explains his songs and his battle with ads
2851,I don&#39;t think I could laugh anymore when he said &quot;what the fuck is going on?&quot;
2852,"My sister literally sent me your reaction to the sound of silence (the cover from disturbed. 🤘) an hour ago, and as a 41 year old woman, I grew up on both of these songs. (I knew sound of silence when Simon and Garfunkel did it.) Lol it warms my heart to watch you really listen to the old stuff, and actually try to understand it, instead of just disregarding it because it&#39;s not the new shit. To know the music is to know the generation that listened to it. I totally appreciate that, and I&#39;m totally subbed. Rock on man, because you&#39;ll become one of us that listen to EVERYTHING. lol"
2853,Please listen to the Beatles at some point. You won’t regret it. :)
2854,I have never laughed so hard !!!! This was great
2855,His reaction to this masterpiece of a song was like my first orgasm 😂😂😂
2856,"Shaq, Sweet Child O Mine by Guns n Rose&#39;s should be your next video. It would be perfect for the channel and it&#39;s an amazing song"
2857,The song is about killing someone and standing trial...&quot; will you let me go...&quot;No&quot; &quot; is the jury
2858,There’s no way that a grown up man is just listening to this song for the first time
2859,I love seeing when he’s about to pause but gets too into the song and even understanding the motion to continue listening. It’s like rewarding his curiosity and keeping him in suspense at the same time
2860,You&#39;re dead set fucking hilarious man hahahahahha
2861,Freddy Mercury’s voice is that of an angel.
2862,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m23s"">6:23</a>"

2867,Freddie Mercury is the name of the singer
2868,This is the best reaction to this song I&#39;ve seen so far! Bloody hilarious 👍
2869,"At 27, I learned that when Freddie Mercury said “just killed a man” he was referencing the aids epidemic, and the fact that he gave the disease to another man. Crazy... that adds so much depth to the song that I didn’t see before"
2870,What the fuck is going on 🤣
2871,Best Reaction Ever 👍

2897,By far the best reaction 100% coach.... slow it down.....🤣🤣🤣 WTH 10.44 reason I love your channel. BEST REACTION VID EVER......
2898,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m10s"">3:10</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m24s"">6:24</a> are the funniest reactions no cap 🧢"
2899,god bless freddy
2900,You need to listen to &quot;Fat Bottom Girls&quot;
2901,I love Queen. Freddie Mercury is the lead singer.
2902,Brother Shaq.. try &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; by Led Zeppelin if you haven&#39;t already!!
2903,When freddy founded out he had HIV he wrote this piece of art.
2904,Great video.
2905,Thunder kiss 65!!!!!By Rob zombie
2906,He reacts the way everyone wants their friend to react when we show them our new favorite song
2907,Freddie Mercury was so amazing!
2908,Thank you YouTube recommendation all I know I was watching some guy rage at Wii sports basketball and now I&#39;m here and this is glorious
2909,Freddie Mercury if you heard We Are The Champion that is the same band.  FYI he has four extra teeth in his uppers.  He can also sing Opera.
2910,Lead singer&#39;s name of Queen is Freddie Mercury and passed away due to AIDS in 1991 r.i.p
2911,Freddie Mercury you should check out how he has the crowd in the live aid concert
2912,"I fucking love u homie! I’m dying laughing, I’m rap fan but grew up on this due to my parents. But reaction is fucking amazing, totally got a new subscriber"
2913,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m10s"">6:10</a> reactions had me dead omg"
2914,"Freddy Mercury! A Rock God, A Rock Legend and an Angel!"
2915,&quot;Them niggas sound like angels!&quot;
2916,"The most interesting thing about this song is the dubbing process which took over 180 overdubs. They worked on 16 and 24 track equipment and had to record and re-record over and over again to achieve the final outcome. Only Freddie knew what he was trying to achieve and the rest of the band members supported this painstaking process. I only imagine if Freddie would have been alive today, what music he and the band would be belting out by using all the digital enhancements and audio software available. True genius."
2917,"Love you and your reactions, and this is SPECTACULAR!!! ❤"
2918,"@nolifeshaq Have to check out Pink Floyd: the wall...mother, another brick in the wall (pt 1, 2 and 3) comfortably numb, is there anybody out there? and hey you are the most known but the entire album is awesome...keep up the good work love watching your videos"

2920,"<a href=""http://google.ca/"">Google.ca</a>"
2921,You want some great metal to hear...2 words IRON fuckin MAIDEN
2922,love the honest reactions you have
2923,I&#39;ve noticed that you&#39;ve started to listen to some more of queen&#39;s catalog of music; you mentioned in this video how the start of the song didn&#39;t even sound like rock; that was part of the beauty of Queen; when they wrote their music they experimented with almost every song they did and because of that almost none of their music sounds similar to each other. It&#39;s honestly pretty amazing to see what they were able to accomplish musically together and how they were able to constantly go outside of their comfort zone in order to try out new things and it paid off spectacularly for them.<br><br>Bohemian Rhapsody for them is probably one of the best ways to show off their talent because this song is actually somewhere between 3-6 different smaller melodies that the band managed to transition together into a diverse and interesting to listen to song.
2924,YOU&#39;VE GOTTA LISTEN TO QUEEN - KILLER QUEEN!!!!!
2925,Yeah these niggas cold af 💀💀
2926,Lol you said they sound like angels . Yes they did but they were far from being angels.

2937,"I LOVE YOUR REACTIONS! 53 yo white gal, who grew up with 70s rock..there is Soooo much you NEED to hear. I&#39;m glad your helping to spread the joy! Thank you<br><br>Blood sweat and tears<br>The guess who"
2938,Did you live under a rock? Why have you never heard any of this stuff
2939,Fuck off you know this song or heard it at least once in your life. On purpose or accidentally.
2940,"<b>Please like this comment so he can see it</b> For one of your next videos you should definitely check out a Muse song. It’s an English rock band. They’re not as known as Aerosmith, Metallica, Queen, Nirvana, AC/DC etc. but they’re still pretty famous. I would recommend “The Handler”, “Psycho”, or “Reapers” (all three are from their album “Drones”) if you want to hear some hard rock, or “Knight of Cydonia”, Starlight”, (both from the “Black Hole and Revelations” album) “Uprising”, (“The Resistance” album) “Time is Running Out”, (Absolution) or “Plug in Baby” (Origin Of Symmetry). I think you would really like them! There’s great guitar riffs, and the singer can hit pretty high notes and has a pretty unique voice!"

2959,Classic reaction!  lol!  I was feeling lonely and then found this channel! Loving it!
2960,You want to see how influential Queen was? Watching the the Live Aid concert. You will be blown away.
2961,JOHN LENNON- IMAGINE
2962,Freddy Mercury
2963,"The singer&quot;s name is Freddie Mercury, though he was born as Farrokh Bulsara and his parents were from India. He spend a part of his childhood in India learning music before finally moving to UK."
2964,The minute you open your horizons you will see color 🙌🏽
2965,LMAO~ Best reactions to this song ever!~
2966,Your reaction to Queen was classic.. LMAOOOOOO
2967,"So here&#39;s a crazy suggestion. Steve Earl and the song Copperhead Road. Bagpipes, heavy drums, and a country twang. It sounds insane but it works. Love your reactions! I&#39;ve been watching for hours now"
2968,You should react to ring of fire by home free
2969,"U can watch in fingerstyle cover bro react for this👇<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/6RN8BoBLj2E"">https://youtu.be/6RN8BoBLj2E</a>"

2978,I&#39;m to high for this reaction 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 &quot;what the fuck is going on&quot; 😂😂😂 that&#39;s tough!
2979,Was #1 on the charts for a very long time. Every queen song is a different genre
2980,I’ve been listening to this song since I was a baby. I knew every word before any other song. But for years I always “figured out” what they were about. My aunt didn’t know that Roxanne was about a hooker etc. But only now am I realizing bohemian rhapsody is about a trial. I feel dumb lmao.
2981,"Kanye West attempted to steal this song,and well ....it&#39;s best not to watch it as a reaction because that    level of utter humiliation needs to be done in private.Unless you want to do it for the channel because I would love to see the pity you will have for that man"
2982,"idk if someone commented this yet, but you NEED to watch the Wayne&#39;s World movie. Especially the car scene with this song."

2987,RIP Freddie &lt;3
2988,"I have to believe this song is about living and dying from HIV.  Hence the gentle: put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he’s dead, etc. Wayne’s World made a joke of this song but I think it’s really about facing an early and unavoidable death."
2989,Queen. Lead singer Freddy Mercury ❤
2990,His name is freddie mercury
2991,Try nirvana
2992,Freddy Mercury!!!! Rip

2997,LMAO... &quot;Bruh...I dont know if I wanna throw my phone at my mamma or call my mamma and say I love you or something&quot;... too funny!
2998,When no life Shaq said that this song goes from a Christmas song to Halloween it reminded me on why this was the soundtrack for The animation Nightmare Before Christmas.  Thats tuff

3000,Your reactions are so amazing. Thank you so much. I&#39;m 34 this is a long time favorite of mine. However I feel like I&#39;m experiencing it for the first time all over with you.
3001,"Freddie Mercury! He was a vision, and a visionary. Gone get before his time"
3002,&quot;Queen y’all are bipolar” 😂
3003,"Honestly, part of me wanted to doubt that Shaq was hearing these songs in full for the first time--because how the hell can you, it&#39;s Queen! It&#39;s Aerosmith! It&#39;s AC/DC!!<br>But I&#39;m a black person in my 20s, and I hadn&#39;t heard classic rock until I started watching VH1 specials and countdowns when I was 14/15. There&#39;s just something about American blackness that kind of...gatekeeps itself, an implicit attitude of &quot;Black people don&#39;t listen to that,&quot; so I never sought out anything but motown, rap, R&amp;B, hip hop, and radio play pop. Why would I? <br>So even if he is playing it up for the video, I can definitely believe that he might never have heard Bohemian Rhapsody in full until now."

He talks about how he was a naïve, innocent kid, nothing mattered or bothered him, &amp; he was tempted into homosexuality. Got aids. Listen to the lyrics with that understanding &amp; you’ll hear what I’m saying."
3057,Don&#39;t laugh wtf&#39;s wrong with you
3058,That&#39;s called being mindfucked by Queen 👑! 😂
3059,Now you need to see the movie recently released about the rise of the band Queen.
3060,"This video should really be titled, &quot;First reaction to seeing &amp; hearing a real Angel&quot; :-)"

He is talking about the lover giving him the disease. Later when talking about the shakes and fever. He knows he will probably die from the disease. The rest is just him lamenting to his mother, or the world?"

3119,You should see the movie!! It was absolutely phenomenal!!
3120,"Most hip hop artists listeners mostly just listen that genre. Its unfortunate. Strong reaction to operatic and rock mix is common.  I&#39;m grad you broaden your musical experience.  Now you see what you have been denying yourself. I&#39;m not knocking hip hop, but classical music has endured for hundreds of years.  I think Queen will too."
3121,one of the greats songs ever created!
3122,&quot;They sound like angels!&quot; Hahaha yep.
3123,And that’s why everyone loves queen. They are unlike any other rock band out past or present.

3128,Need to listen to who wants to live forever!!
3129,I love to see everyone&#39;s first time reaction to Queen!!!! Good music is just good music no matter the genre!!!

3133,It&#39;s suppose to be how life is the ups and downs wild side steps and the whole works. There&#39;s a lot of meaning behind it 😁
3134,Fun fact: this is said to be the 1st modern music video<br>Okay I looked and looked through the comments and am sure is somewhere down there but I couldn&#39;t find so I leave my little piece of knowledge here
3135,Brian May on guitar. He&#39;s one of the worlds greatest guitarists.
3136,Freddie Mercury is his name. He wrote this song...All by himself.
3137,Freddy Mercury loved opera thats how he created rock opera its awesome
3138,Queen is awesome all of his songs are! So are led zepplins Lynard Skinner get into some southren rock I think you would love it! His Freddy Mercury give him a while for the rock to move in slowly! Guns and rose&#39;s
3139,Check out their Live Aid show they did. Pretty awesome stuff.
3140,"&quot;These boys came from a happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick&quot;. Shaq, you the best!"
3141,Freddie mercury was the lead singer
3142,"Shaq I lost it watching this reaction &quot;Queen there all bipolar&quot; &quot;singing in this ear and crying in this one&quot; and &quot;this ni&amp;&amp;a sounds like an angel&quot; you just summed up 35 years of my life. The engineering of the master recording back then was to suit quadrophonic speaker set ups ( some poncy mixer will probably tell me I&#39;m wrong ) they sounded awesome in the car stereo on the Dolby cassette  rolling left to right front to back. Jimi Hendrix Purple Haze is the same but one you and most of your viewers won&#39;t have heard of is an Australian band called Midnight Oil, they do a song called &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; epic drum solo in a 1980&#39;s car, it just rolls from speaker to speaker"
3143,I am 19 and i found queen randomly on YouTube 3 years ago and I haven&#39;t been able to stop listen it 😅😂

3146,FREDDY MERCURY!!!!! LEGEND!!
3147,Your videos are the best.  This one was great.  Gotta watch Bohemian Rhapsody.
3148,You need to research the history behind this song. Freddy Mercury was a gay man that died from AIDS.  So if you listen to the words it&#39;s telling his story
3149,I love how he refers to queen as &quot;niggas&quot; lmao
3150,I never knew Queen was so cool.
3151,Dude...Don&#39;t ever stop in mid of an guitar solo.
3152,DO ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST!!! Queen
3153,"If you would like to hear and react to the best cover of Bohemian Rhapsody ever ( some say  better than the original( What!!!!) well, I never believed I would say this but.... equal to???. You will be amazed. They are a k-pop group ( 4 members)  and they KILLED IT!!! Please Ken YouTube :<br>“Forestella Bohemian Rhapsody”<br>All the coaches and reactors were in shock. <br>So please ken or all your subscribers or you who are reading this who love Queen please please please ( only if privately) react and be in total disbelief!!"

3155,Great choice
3156,I know this is an older video but you should do queens fat bottom girls
3157,You are a very unique talent who has an incredible and a natural ease in front of a camera...
3158,react to smells like teen spirit
3159,Look up the meaning of Bohemian Rhapsody
3160,This is Freddie Mercury&#39;s unofficial coming out song as a bisexual man in the 1970s. In the 1970s many countries still had sodomy laws that could have resulted in his imprisonment for loving someone of the same-sex. It also is letting his family know he isn&#39;t going to deny who he is.
3161,Queen  is one band that got different vocal styles  when they sing.
3162,don&#39;t throw your phone at your poor momma Shaq. 😂😂
3163,Do Fat bottom girls by Queen
3164,Freddy Mercury
3165,Great reaction as usual!❤
3166,I like your other hip hop videos but I feel like you kind of missed it on this one I get that this is your first queen experience so ima let this one slide
3167,U gotta watch the movie bohemian rhapsody was good ass movie. It tells u about his life.

3184,I had to subscribed to your channel. <br>I love it!
3185,Queen was one of the first musicians if not the first musicians to use the quadrophonic sound effect (different sounds in different speakers)
3186,You have to do a reaction to JOURNEY!!!!
3187,"I like to go into a bar and play this song on the jukebox. Then I ease up to the bar between a couple of hot chicks and say, &quot;Yeah...I remember when I wrote and performed this song. It was a really groovy session, heh heh.&quot; The chicks get all excited and start hanging all over me, and the guys all buy me drinks, and as the song plays, I&#39;m Mister Awesome to everyone in the bar! Then when it&#39;s over, I say &quot;PSYCHE!!! I didn&#39;t really write and sing that song, DUMMIES!!!&quot; Then I drop my pants and hop out of the bar, laughing."
3188,Hey Shaq: My brother turned me on to your site. I&#39;m you average 63 year old white guy social worker who&#39;s also a singer-songwriter.

3194,I think this song he coming to terms with his sexuality.
3195,Freddie Mercury not even from The UK.
3196,I&#39;ve yet to meet anyone who does not head bang to this one
3197,Great video.  Have you ever done a reaction video to Queen at Live Aid?  It&#39;s considered the greatest live performance ever by many.
3198,Freddie Murcury
3199,"Freddy mercury was in the closet for the longest time. That song was his way of coming out before coming out. Read between the lines, music is an outlet you just need to open your mind."
3200,Have you watched the Queen  &quot;Live Aid&quot; performance? It is arguably the greatest live show of all time!
3201,"The Legend that is Freddie Mercury with Brian May guitar, Roger Taylor drums and John Deacon bass. The best band ever. Nobody can ever come close to that voice and have the live band of such talented individuals that come together so well"

3211,So gays in the 80&#39;s were like this. And in the early 2000&#39;s it was high school musical. Lol
3212,They were gay. The rock life of drugs and sex and all that. He gave his partner Aids. His partner died. He died sometime later from Aids too. They were all afflicted from their life choices.

3222,"Maths teacher: &quot;Understood?&quot;<br>Me: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m07s"">7:07</a>"
3223,Seeing someone react to this for the first time gave me chills
3224,"Process of a mans feelings, emotional feelings, what he&#39;s going through and the judicial system."
3225,I felt you feel that shit in your toes🤣
3226,"Oh honey, you just getting started. <br>I love your honest reaction it&#39;s the same way I felt when I first heard him over 40 years ago"
3227,do u really have to cut at guitar part :(
3228,im only 35 but i love queen bc of my mom and freddie mercury is a great opera singer
3229,"FYI Their poppier stuff- the real famous ones- are good, but the reeeeally cool ones are more obscure. Ones like Innuendo, Prophet’s Song, March of the Black Queen, Fairy-Feller’s Master Stroke, and Ogre Battle."
3230,The first harmony is done by freddy alone.
3231,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m18s"">5:18</a> <b>when u try to sing like  Freddy</b>"
3232,Freddy wrote that song when he knows about he gonna die
3233,Check out &quot;Who wants to live forever.&quot;
3234,I&#39;m assuming coach doesn&#39;t know about &quot;under pressure&quot; and the history of vanilla ice.
3235,"To the 874 thumbs down, I’ll pray for you."
3236,I’m into rap a loooooooottt but i love queen man nnnigga this nigga freddie is legendary
3237,&quot;sound like a christmas carol&quot; lmao I LOVE YOU
3238,My favorite song of all time! This is a road trip essential! Every road trip this is played on max with everyone in the car singing. It&#39;s like a law of nature or something!
3239,"Young man, I truly enjoy your straight off the cuff reactions, wholeheartedly.  I implore you to react to Queen at Live Aid 1985. I understand your hesitation with the length of the video. I promise, promise, promise, that it&#39;ll be the shortest 20 plus minutes of your life AND the GREATEST live performance you will watch. I, too, am a Michael Jackson fan, but this live presentation is what every other live performance, in my opinion, is graded against. Keep up the passionate reactions! Thank You!"
3240,Cracking up:<br>This turned from a Christmas morning to Halloween&quot; Your reactions truly make me cry with laughter. I binged watched you for two days straight.
3241,"Bro, I started watching you months ago, but today man I got on  I watched one react. Then another. I started at 1030 a.m. it&#39;s 830 p.m. and I&#39;m still finding reacts to click on. Dats Tuff! <br><br><br>But I can&#39;t help but notice I have not seen ONE SINGLE SEETHER REACT?!?! <br><br><br>SEETHER FANS, LIKE THIS UP"
3242,as you mention headphones. Bohamian Rhapsody uses all high and low notes. So if you buy new speakers (headphones and so on) test them with this song.
3243,The song is about him getting and transmitting aids.
3244,Dude that’s the 70’s for ya! Lol Lots of drugs!!! 🙃😜 but Queen was crazy talented! No one is like them or ever will be 👍👏
3245,Obviously never saw Wayne’s World.
3246,You are so funny from a 62 year old grandma
3247,Welcome to the wonderful world of REAL music^^
3248,I thought this would be just a stupid reaction video but this was epic! Thanks for sharing this.
3249,I so love your reaction to the songs us 50 year olds grew up with when there was no internet ! Your the best keep it up !
3250,You rock bro the best reaction to queen ever!!!!
3251,"Gday Shaq all the way from Australia I really dig your reviews it puts a smile on my face every day keep up the great work, love to see your review on Deep Purple Child in time live at the bbc if you havnt done it already. Cheers mate keep rockin"
3252,Best reaction ever!
3253,"Freddy Mercury is his name, sounding like an angel is his game. He was gay, but he owned it. And some say Bohemian Rhapsody was his coming out song."
3254,Have you never heard the name of the legendary Freddy Mercury?
3255,"I love how you look as if you&#39;re reacting to &quot;2 girls, 1cup&quot;."
3256,"For Freddy, the spectacle was as important as the music. No more apparent than in this song."
3257,"&quot;Momma, just killed a man&quot; he just told his mother he was gay"
3258,Freddie Mercury was the lead singer and very unique. I&#39;m so glad he didn&#39;t have his teeth fixed. He embraced his look and everybody loved him more for that!! Unlike Cher who ran out and bought new teeth as soon as she earned enough money!!
3259,Best reaction ever lmao🤣🤣‼
3260,Omg your face expressions are priceless that&#39;s tuff 🤣🤣🤣
3261,"Freddy Mercury (the lead vocalist) is consider one of the greatest male vocals of all time.  Even his vocal cords were mutated, giving him is considered the best control and range for male vocalist in any genre."
3262,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m31s"">5:31</a> <br>Us: No, don’t press pause!<br>Shaq: ~looks like he’s gonna pause~<br>Us: Shaq, plz no! This is one of the best parts!<br>Shaq:<br>Us: 😣🤞🏻<br>Shaq:<br><br><br><br>Fucking Shaq: ~pauses~"
3263,"That&#39;s one thing I miss about cassette tapes.  Digital music is crisp and clear, yes, but cassettes would often split the sound up through different headphones or speakers, to mix up the feel.  Don&#39;t get that often anymore.  It&#39;s just one wall of sound now."
3264,One of the best BH reactions I&#39;ve ever seen.  LOL!
3265,...stops the video and says “what the f is going on!?” Lmao 😂
3266,Another One Bites The Dust 🎶😉
3267,“Queen?! Ya’ll are bipolar!”<br><br>“That’s an emotional roller coaster!”<br><br>So appropriate!
3268,"Freddie Mercury, RIP"
3269,I’m dying lmao you’re the best thing that happened to the Internet 😂
3270,go bucks
3271,U2
3272,Gloria.  U2
3273,Bad.        U2
3274,"This isn&#39;t soul music, but music from the soul."
3275,&quot;Queen y&#39;all are bipolar!&quot; 🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
3276,Freddie Mercury is the most charismatic person to ever hit a stage. <br>Watch him at the Live Aid concert...he controlled that crowd like no one else could.
3277,"LOL!!I loved your reactions!! Your expressions and comments are hilarious and priceless,so thank you for completely changing my day and reminding me about the beautiful things in life.<br>There&#39;s no other song like Bohemian Rhapsody,but I thought you might like these songs.<br>Wish you were here by Pink Floyd<br>Tonight,Tonight by Smashing Pumpkins<br>Zombie by The Cranberries<br>Love Hurts,by Nazareth"
3278,"FYI: Freddie Mercury was bisexual and died of AIDS in 1991 when no one really knew what it was.  This song is actually about him finding out he had AIDS and he was going to die from it.  &quot;Momma, just killed a man. Put my gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead.&quot;   That&#39;s about giving someone else HIV."
3279,&quot;It sounds like a Christmas carol.&quot;  LOL.  Then watch out.
3280,😂
3281,"This song was meant to be a mini operetta with all the transitions included. First part was the murderer reflecting about killing and the subsequent arrest. He&#39;s aching and having shivers because he&#39;s having a drug withdrawal in jail. The trial is where we have the choir with him asking to be let go and being told no. He is judged guilty and then comes in the hard guitar riffs and the defiant &quot;so you think you can just eave me to die...&quot; as he is being drug away to rot in prison. Nothing really matters is the ending part where he&#39;s accepting his fate of being locked up in prison as he goes back to the &quot;easy come easy go hit me where the breeze goes&quot; style again. Yes it is a very dynamic song, but many Queen songs are that way as they were trying to create a unique style of storytelling. Hence why their songs continue to stand the test of time."
3282,Freddie Mercury!! Queen is the best!!  Watch their live performance at “Live Aid” the power he has over the crowd is amazing. True legends.
3283,The lead vocalist name is Freddie Mercury.. Goes  in theatres now...  recommend you see it..

3296,"Seriously watch the movie bohemian rhapsody,  really good film"
3297,Cuzz say they sound like angels lmao 😂
3298,"It&#39;s priceless, seeing your reaction to this song.  I was a black girl growing up on the southeast side of Cleveland Oh.  I was in high school and I loved this music.   My older brother turned me on to Led Zeppelin.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong I loved my soul music and Loved jazz.  But this was my other side that most of my friends were puzzled with.  Still love my rock!!!  ROCK ON!!!"
3299,Freddy Mercury was a genius
3300,"Hey man, you’re genuinely funny. I appreciate you. Funniest shit yet. “ I don’t know if I want to throw my phone at my mom or call my mom and tell her I lover.“ I fell out at that point."

3317,"Omg, this song is definitely a great one but super weird as well.... lol! Your reaction kinda summed it up .I mean Freddie M could sing his face off but it&#39;s honestly hard to watch him knowing his history..."
3318,It&#39;s an experience!
3319,"Pure joy, coach. &lt;3 There is no preparing oneself for the phenomenon known as Queen. ;)"
3320,"Never title was more correct: bohemian rhapsody. The best musical skills, from classic to rock, based on such human, dark and sensitive contents... just one word...  queen"

I am not really sure if you realize, (from my point of view anyways...and based off of the hundreds and hundreds of positive comments on all of your reaction videos that I have read since I have &#39;discovered&#39; your wonderful You Tube Channel only a few weeks ago), how inspiring, uplifting, gifted, genuine, appreciative, funny (POOR JA RULE AND THAT LONG WIG THAT YOU PUT ON...LOL), creative, open-minded, fun, humble and truly real you are to your  &#39;No life gang&#39;. I could have a really tough day, and all I have to do is check out another one of your videos...and I am cracking up and smiling. I also love how you ask us things that you are not sure of...because you genuinely want to know. You are a natural entertainer. I appreciate you and your work and love that you always find the time to express how you appreciate all of us. You are real! Your channel, (and of course...YOU) to me, is one of the few platforms out there that has me feeling connected in a positive way to everyone on it. I get a sense of UNITY here, so here I shall stay (I just subscribed). Thank you for being you! Shout out to JoJo and King! ---- Ok....how many of you want a T-Shirt with:   Shaq&#39;s cartoon pic on it.... his You Tube channel address, his twitter (to support him further) and a comment on the back  that maybe says &quot;LET&#39;S GET IT&quot;!  on it ?????????   Shaq....I&#39;ll be the first one to buy one."
3326,I&#39;m surprised no one has suggested Hotel California to you. But I&#39;m sure they already have.
3327,This song is Is often regarded as one of the greatest song of all time
3328,I need a translation for this... can hardly understand what he&#39;s saying...
3329,"good to see him being exposed to talented musicians and beautiful instruments, lyrics and music.  Real music, not computerized manipulations"

3347,"SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK, QUEEN...AND &quot;IT&#39;S LATE&quot; AND &quot;SPREAD YOUR WINGS&quot;!!"
3348,The late great Freddie Mercury
3349,Dude just ran across your video....im a rock musician and child of the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.  Queen is probably the best rock group of all time.  they broke norms in rock music...paved their own way and developed a sound so unequaled even to this day.  Freddie Mercury is one of the best vocalists of all time.  This song is about a guy who kills someone and is put on death row.  He&#39;s talking to his mama and regrets what he has done.  Pretty much it...it&#39;s one of the greatest songs ever.  Glad you thought it was ok :)
3350,You will Understand this song when you check out the life story of Freddie Mercury  The lead singer .  One Clue is in the name of the Band.
3351,"Queen!! you&#39;all are bipolar!!....&quot; I&#39;m raging on this side, and crying on the other...&quot;. His commentary&#39;s are  Brilliant!"
3352,Queen didnt use synthesizers in their biggest albums.  All of the amazing affects were done in the studio.  They were/are perfectionists and that&#39;s why we live them!
3353,"at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a> was soooo good. He was Flabbergasted! I choked on my drink as Shaq spits out."
3354,"Fun fact: Brian May, the lead guitarist, built that guitar he plays from scratch, and still plays it to this day. It doesn&#39;t sound like any other."
3355,Tupaq redid those lyrics
3356,"Isn&#39;t Rock Opera grand? This song goes from intro, to murder, to trial, to &quot;I&#39;m not dead you twit!&quot;"
3357,I&#39;m pretty sure this was written about Freddie who was dying from AIDS. If you really listen to the lyrics it sounds like it.
3358,He had me dead on the switch up
3359,I would love to see your reaction to Prophet&#39;s Song from Queen&#39;s Night at the Opera album!
3360,"Fun fact, the opening vocals are all just one man. Freddie Mercury, harmonizing with himself."
3361,Watching you react to videos makes my day not shit. Thank you sir haha.
3362,I love that your opening your ears to new music. I’ve always liked all music as long as it sounded good but I can get liking on specific genre.
3363,I&#39;m a new sub and I&#39;m very late here but please do try giving the Live Aid Queen performance a try. Maybe if you want something else you can try any one of Angel Vivaldi&#39;s playthroughs
3364,Go Bubba go 😂
3365,Yo Shaq if you like this you should check out The Show Must Go On it&#39;ll blow your mind
3366,Queen is the ONLY band I will not listen to any covers of their songs. Just can&#39;t.
3367,The lead singer is Freddie Mercury best vocalist of all times hands down the song is more theatrical than their normal stuff but it is the best song ever created by them or anyone for that matter
3368,Freddy Mercury was a genius.
3369,A Quern must....Dragon attack!!
3370,"CLICK... SUBSCRIBED...   You have my ear, play what You will...  never stop being genuine... that is what stopped me in my tracks!"
3371,"Lol when I first heard this song I too was thinking what the hell is happening here, so many emotions,? Now I understand and appreciate the true artistry of this song and Queen. A classic and just amazingly brilliant!"
3372,"Dude, NEVER interrupt the operatic part in the middle!! Never!!!  :)"

3436,"LOL!! This song is about his love life. Freddie is gay and when he, &quot;Shot a man with his gun,&quot; well there ya go. He was afraid of his mom not accepting him, (and everyone else), and getting HIV, which is why he doesn&#39;t want to, &quot;Die,&quot; because in that time period, they only thought HIV and Gay men equates to death. This is actually a pretty deep song lol"
3437,"You have to check out more Queen music.  This one is the most genius, imaginative, hard ass song ever!"
3438,how can you say something so brutal...so nicely...teriffic

3440,HAHAHA lmao
3441,Freddie Mercury......THE GOD OF MUSIC!!!
3442,In my opinion the greatest through-composed piece of all time. Through-composed meaning that there are no verses and choruses and the form is essentially ABCD. Brilliant reaction to a brilliant song though.
3443,Watch Queen at Live Aid. Awesome performance!
3444,Honest joyful comments- Best reactions ever - a smile a day “ my guy.....that’s tuff “😊🤣😂
3445,🤣😂🤣
3446,he said it the way he did because he was talking about himself. It was all a metaphor about how he &quot;killed&quot; his old self to create this new persona that is Freddie Mercury because he family didn&#39;t like what he was doing with his life and this was his way of talking about it
3447,The singers name is freddie mercury

3490,My man!! Watch the movie!! The ending gives awhole different look at the song
3491,"You, my friend, have just reacted to THE BEST SONG EVER WRITTEN AND EVER SUNG BY ANYONE IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I don&#39;t care if you like traditional popular music, classic music, opera, Folk, Country, Rhythm and Blues, Rock, Hip Hop...WHAT-FUCKING-EVER. Bohemian Rhapsody is a master piece of master pieces. From Freddy Mercury&#39;s voice to the harmonies of the backup, to the guitar solos, to the piano, to the video effects, THE LYRICS and the story they told...everything about it is technical perfection, it&#39;s absolutely flawless and it makes you feel things. AWESOME."
3492,"It is a song about the struggle for a human soul and the depth of emotion that can come from a fateful mistake. It is supposed to be a ride through the emotions and ultimately leave us with the realization that we are all inconsequential in the end, to quote another classic we are all but dust in the wind... Or at least that is my interpretation of it anyhow.  Thanks for reacting to the classics I love seeing others enjoy the music I grew up with."
3493,Ha ha ha hold on hold on <br><br>Signature line
3494,"Hahaha “... from a happy Christmas morning to Hallowe’en, real quick.” So far, this is my favourite reaction comment. 😁👍🏼"

3505,&quot;What the fuck is going on?!?!&quot;
3506,You know this song spends months at #1 when it first came out and then spent a few more months at #1 again 16 years after it first came out?

3520,&quot;I&#39;m raging on this side and crying on this side&quot;... Pretty much sums up the entire song lol. It&#39;s a song about him coming out of the closet.
3521,Love it -- i&#39;m raging on this side and crying on the other!
3522,Most music of the 60s and 70s was meant to be listened to through headphones.
3523,This song was written after their agent said they had to define their music. Can not define this song. As you said “ Christmas to Halloween”
3524,"If you give a listen, the song is a metaphorical rendition about Freddie Mercury(frontman) disclosing his homosexuality to the world."
3525,"EPIC reactions.  True though, they do make you feel both sides of the coin at the same time."
3526,Queen bipolar...LMAO.  Too good.
3527,We need to get Shaq some Who to listen to!!!
3528,Love Queen!  The all time best singer ever.  Try Johnny Cash&#39;s &quot;Hurt&quot; : so good!
3529,i just discovered this channel (previously watched the free bird reaction). i am amazed you were that old when you heard queen for the first time :S
3530,I love your reactions. Gotta love some rock opera from Queen. <br>I just found your page tonight from Lynyrd Skynyrd sharing your review of Free Bird.
3531,Love your shit buddy.  You need to do Welcome to the jungle by Guns&amp;Roses
3532,The Who...Baba O&#39;Riley. You need to listen to this one next!
3533,What a piece of crap. I can never get those few minutes back.  I would rather watch children reacting to great music than watch this idiot.
3534,Hahaha. Cracks me up.  I once hated this song as a  young dude.  But it grew on me to be one of my favorites.
3535,Over dramatic much
3536,im dying here from laughin...
3537,Love you!! You make me laugh so hard lol
3538,"You have now heard greatness, meet Freddie Mercury."
3539,&quot;The transitions in this song is outrageous!&quot; Truer words were never spoken.
3540,OMG ITS FREDDIE MERCURY
3541,"If you want to hear an angelic song by this band, please listen to “ Who wants to live forever” The video is from the Highlander that came out in 1986. Omgosh!!! Heavenly and beautiful surrounded by all these candles and it’s enough to make you cry and smile at the same time.❤️❤️❤️"
3542,BISMILLA- means “ in the name of God”’ in Arabic. ❤️❤️
3543,"The lead singer and piano player Farrok Bulsara- he was born in Africa in Zanzabar, Tanzania. His parents were Persians born in India but fled to Africa to avoid Iranian and Muslim persecution. His parents were of Zoroastrian faith and they believed in good words, thoughts. &amp; deeds. Very peaceful religion and then he changed his name to Freddie Mercury in 1970. He could play the guitar as well!! “ crazy Little thing called love”❤️❤️"
3544,This song is about Freddie coming to terms with his own sexuality.
3545,"Freddy Mercury, one of the greatest musical minds and voices every to live.  Taken way too soon.  Queen was undoubtedly one of the greatest band to ever grace a stage."
3546,"People don’t realize that this video was Freddy’s concept. Not another director. And it was this video that really put Queen on the map, so to speak. This is where his and the whole band’s real genius started to get the attention they all deserved! Their ‘Killer Queen’ album was my very first album I ever got. I picked it as my Christmas present to myself!"
3547,You got it from Christmas Day to Halloween.
3548,My favorite band ever!  Thanks!!!
3549,Back in the day it was said this song was about his finding out he had aids. That would be a good reason for it to be a roller coaster feel. The line where he says did you just think you could love me and leave me to die. Freddy did finally die from complications of aids. Sad.
3550,This is one of the funniest  things i have ever seen on the internet
3551,"I&#39;m big HIP HOP fan now but back in the day Rock and Metal was my thing. I started watching you cuz of Eminem and then found these Rock reactions. I&#39;m lvoin&#39; them. I know all these songs but haven&#39;t listen to them in years, its so fun watching you discovering them! Queen, AC/DC, Black Sabbeth! Rock on brother!"
3552,How in the hell you never heard this classic before!!???
3553,Freddie Mercury. The best song writer/lead singer of all time.
3554,"Good morning!!  Thank you for all of your posts to your first reactions to this era of music.  This is the music I grew up with, and raised my boys to know, along with all different genres.  As they grew up they brought all sorts of different music home to listen to and for us all to share.  Your videos are how we three as a family have always felt about new music to our ears! My boys had several bands growing up, and both are musicians today!  I wanted to just reach out and to thank you for posting these videos.  I get such intense joy and even giddiness from many of your reactions - but I am thrilled that you have opened up conversation for a whole new group of people to listen to all sorts of music.  You say often that you haven&#39;t listened outside of your genre and now hearing these songs, you are really loving it! You have expanded your repertoire, and now that you have opened that door, your experiences will be endless! What a great testament to the power of music, and how it can move us, and make us grow, and give us heartfelt joy!  Please continue to share, to enjoy, and to fill your ears and heart with the endless sounds out there!  I would like to suggest a couple of band to you to give a whirl.  This prog-rock band is tight, and a little crazy.  This is long, so may not be suitable for your show.  The whole album actually is one song.  Here is part 1: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5PJKwkZCvY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5PJKwkZCvY</a>  -  I&#39;d also love you to check out a band that is contemporary today - but their musicality is stoopid-crazy - definitely &quot;musical nerds&quot; too!  Check out the album The Beautiful Game by Vulfpeck  - here&#39;s a song from it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fWZ9FjIK4&amp;list=RDle0BLAEO93g&amp;index=20"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fWZ9FjIK4&amp;list=RDle0BLAEO93g&amp;index=20</a>  Thank you again for these great videos!

3572,Also record your reaction to Renegade by Styx
3573,"Bro, check out more than a feeling by Boston and just know all the guitar music was recorded by 1 man on a tape deck in his basement playing each part individually.  No lie.  Check out the singer’s voice also.  Brad Delp was an awesome vocalist."
3574,"I love this guy, I want to see him check out the Who Baba O&#39;Riley, David Bowie Heroes,  and Jethro Tull Aqualung"
3575,It&#39;s called a power ballad.

3586,"This is an example of why Freddie Mercury is considered, by most music experts, to be the best vocalist in the 143-year history of recorded music."
3587,"You know I know this is random, but when are we gonna have a class with Prince?🤔🤔🤔"
3588,One of the best songwriters in rock. Lost a great artist. I love Flash Gordon. Gotta REACT to this one Shaq.
3589,thismay be the best reaction ever.
3590,"Go old school with Sugarhill gang and Rappers&#39;s delight, it has a sample of Another one bites the dust."

3598,"Brilliant.  You are.   So, once you run out of material change it up, because when you show yourself, we want to hear it."
3599,Would it surprise you to know that lead guitarist Brian May is an astrophysicist? Freddie Mercury had degrees in design and music. Brian and his father built his guitar out of scrap wood.
3600,Freddie Mercury my guy!! LEGEND!!!
3601,Stop pausing nigga!
3602,These ppl need to stop lying about bohemian Rhapsody I mean every one effing knows about this song
3603,I guarantee you never change this song on the radio again.
3604,"I love it when you get to watch someone discover new music, especially stuff that’s not what they usually listen to. I’ve been listening to Beyoncé for the first time all week. Love your reactions-keep ‘em coming!  *Try TV On The Radio (great band)! Cheers."
3605,I can&#39;t stop smiling at your genuine joy discovering Queen :)
3606,- Mr. &#39;NoLifeShaq&#39; --- I&#39;d love to see your reaction to &#39;The Cleverlys&#39; version of the rap tune --- Flo Rida &#39;Low&#39; / Apple Bottom Jeans. <br><br>It&#39;s a Bluegrass version of the rap tune. ---  &quot;Shawty got dem Apple Bottom jeans &amp; the boots with the fur... the whole club was a looking at her...... &quot; <br><br><br>Check it out bro....

3607,I&#39;m gettin&#39; all kinda emotions from this song ......
3608,Christmas to Halloween bwahahahah
3609,"The world needs angels, rock and roll needs soldiers, authentic emotions not compelled by irony. Shaq, what you are doing is art, no doubt. Love your videos bro."
3610,The lead singer was gay he’s basically coming out of the closet he’s killing the man within himself that was straight and becoming the gay man he really is. Telling your mom is probably the hardest thing someone has to do who is coming out because they probably feel like a disappointment. That’s why in the beginning he was saying he killed a man and told his mom he didn’t mean to make her cry because he killed the man that she thought he was and she couldn’t except it he had to leave. It’s a deep song you have to listen to it again knowing what you know now.
3611,November Rain Guns n Roses
3612,Why are you so loud and the music is so soft?  Its distracting..
3613,"Fun Fact: The very beginning of the song, all voices are sang by Freddie Mercury."
3614,He stop track too f&#39;n much..
3615,"This was what basically started music videos. They recorded this as they couldnt have all the equipment there to play live at top of the pops artists usually mimed, so they recorded this and sent it to them....epic"

3632,Bro ever since I started watching your channel it has actually made me happy to see that a man that is used to his people&#39;s genre of music can expand his mind and see that he can feel the emotions from a different type of music that is not exactly connected to his Norm of genre music hear you.. if there were more Brothers like you that would take the time to expand their minds and see that there are other styles of music that you can understand
3633,thank you for letting me hear my favorite music through new ears and eyes.  I&#39;m a 60 year old white guy. You rock!

3637,You need to get out more.
3638,"This was one of the last great bands of that generation. Freddy will always be one of my favorite singers. His range was amazing, the way they arranged songs was perfect. Sadly one of the worst illnesses that can be caught, happened to Freddy, I could only imagine how amazing his music would&#39;ve continued to. But we didn&#39;t get that. But we have this musical masterpiece and fat bottomed girls, bicycle, etc. We were blessed to have heard this man&#39;s greatness and my childhood was better for it."
3639,Check out careless whisper by wham

3643,Lol what the fuck is going on lol
3644,literally no one knew what was going on when this song released... blew their minds
3645,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m45s"">7:45</a> waited the whole video for THAT moment. Loved it!!!! 🤣🤣 I know this is from almost a year ago but if you haven’t checked out Fat Bottom Girls from Queen you need to!!!"
3646,"Freddie Mercury, one of the greatest vocalists every."
3647,This brilliantly written song has as many movements as a Mozart work. Wonderful choice Shaq.
3648,Dat Ooouh Ouhhh tho. Dats Tufff lmao
3649,"The creativity of music in this era and genre is hands down, the best there ever will be. Take into account that they actually played their own instruments. They actually worked."
3650,This bloke is so obnoxious
3651,Legit started rolling at this reaction!😂😂😂😂😂
3652,This song really slaps you back and forth on your face!
3653,RIP Freddy
3654,Only Queen.
3655,Shaq you do not even know how your reactions affect people ...you are the dude....great smile...
3656,Your reaction to this song kept making me laugh.
3657,&quot;bro... WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?&quot; HAHAHAHAHA
3658,ty
3659,Watch Crazy train by Ozzy
3660,"Yours is the best reaction, I can tell you&#39;ve never heard that song before. I was brought up with it. Xx"
3661,One of the best songs ever made
3662,the song is on the album a night at the OPERA! its a huge clue to what is going on!<br>if you like this you should watch their live aid performance.
3663,"I&#39;m a little late to your game but I&#39;m picking up what you&#39;re putting down. <br>Many of us wypipo been listening to this since we were born. I was raised on queen, led zeppelin, pink floyd, ac/dc. That&#39;s why when I hear hip hop I&#39;m kinda like &quot;meh&quot;. I mean, I like it well enough and some of it is real art, but when you were weaned on rock and roll like this...  It&#39;s kinda hard to really get into. <br>Anyway, I love what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;m going to spend today watching a lot of your reaction videos. Thanks for the good music and commentary. It&#39;s very enlightening to hear what someone who has never heard the music that has been the soundtrack to my life has to say about it."
3664,"These boys came from a Happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m18s"">7:18</a>  got me. Cryin&#39; here."
3665,Fred!
3666,"In my opinion,His Royal Highness,Freddy Mercury.This is called a &quot;Rock Opera&quot;"
3667,They turnt up! 😂
3668,"I could be just imagining things based on hindsight, but I&#39;ve always heard this song as Freddie&#39;s coping with his HIV diagnosis.<br>&quot;Mama, just killed a man.  Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead&quot; - His reaction to finding out he gave a partner HIV.  A virtual death sentence at the time.&quot;Life had just begun, but now I&#39;ve gone and thrown it all away.&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t wanna die, sometimes wish I&#39;d never been born at all.&quot;They low-key bury the lyrics about dying and killing other people in this massive song that changes gears so much you never get a chance to pay attention to how bleak it really is, because they force you to get overwhelmed with rocking out.<br><br><br>And Freddie Mercury ... oh my god ... greatest vocalist of all time.  Forget about &quot;male singer&quot; or &quot;rock singer&quot; or any of that bullshit.  Freddie was THE BEST in any genre, any time, no conditions.  Tell me anyone is comparable, I&#39;ll call you a damn liar."
3669,React to Motley Crue 🙌🏻
3670,Love this guys joy at the moment of clarity he gets when he &#39;gets it&#39;... 💚💙💚💙💚💙💚
3671,Considered by many to be the greatest rock song ever. Legends

3673,They sound like angels...
3674,House of pain by Faster Pussycat
3675,His insight is absolutely brilliant!
3676,Your reaction to this was just priceless and you summed it up perfectly!! I think calling it bipolar was just genius .....*tips hat * <br><br>PS Freddie Mercury was a STAR and will be forever missed!!
3677,I am so happy to watch you open your music horizons.
3678,Still one of my favorite reactions.. “OoOoOOooo THATS TOUGH” 😂😂

3680,love your reaction there men !! haha
3681,Queen was like rock opera in this song. So unique they were. Watching your reactions are so good. I know ever since that Lynard Skynard reaction to Free Bird video you&#39;ll be getting a whole lot of new subscriber&#39;s. That shit went viral.
3682,“They went from a happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick” 😂😂
3683,Greatest Bohemian Rhapsody reaction ever. lol
3684,I&#39;m dying dude! You&#39;re killing me! I love your reactions!

3690,"First reaction to Queen, but first video in the recommended videos to right is one of yours &quot;FIRST REACTION TO QUEEN Under Pressure&quot;? THEN you have another one in &#39;Recommended&#39; videos &quot;FIRST TIME HEARING QUEEN Don&#39;t Stop Me Now&quot;? Your &quot;First Reaction&quot; videos is like KISS last tour... &quot;There never is a last tour&quot;. So is there, or when is the, 4th FIRST REACTION to Queen coming out?"
3691,A lot of musicans think that this is the best song ever made
3692,&quot;they go from happy Christmas morning to Halloween&quot;!
3693,React to journey please
3694,Freddie fucking Mercury!!!  Please for an amazing performance do live aid ‘85. Freddie had throat problems and was advised by drs not to sing. Other bands got pissed cause they went on and just half assed it but Freddie took the time to put together a show.  When Freddie came offstage david Bowie said how the hell am I supposed to follow that?  Lol
3695,My bro.....MY BRO that is the FREDDIE MERCURY. I&#39;ve always thought this was about him giving someone aids. That&#39;s why he aching all the time and he thinks theres a devil put aside for him.
3696,&quot;Somebody To Love&quot; by Queen - EPIC song. Please review it (if you haven&#39;t already).
3697,"Of course you&#39;ve heard it, it&#39;s freaking bohemian rapsody"
3698,It used to be radio stations wouldn&#39;t play this song even if you begged &#39;em to on the request line. Then a movie called Wayne&#39;s World hit the theaters and you would hear it ten times a day. This one was almost lost to history.
3699,Have you listened to Hotel California by the eagles?
3700,Yeah sorry you&#39;ve heard bohemian rhapsody before
3701,&quot;Queen yall are bipolar&quot; lmao
3702,"* GRIN *  The headphones make a difference, don&#39;t they?"

3719,Best reaction ever!  wtf is going on!
3720,"I’ve always hated rap music. I could never understand what they were saying (mumble rap? I guess?) but you came up in a suggested video one day and I was bored. So I clicked on it. You entertained me and now I look for you. The fact that you’ve expanded your music genres has really attracted a lot of people I think. Great move on your part. <br>Queen was the bomb for sure. If you listened to this and watched this video with some dank in the dome , you’d love it. Peace out"
3721,Blow by theory of a deadman
3722,Queen are amazing. It’s a story about angels and demons fighting for a lost soul. I love this song.
3723,Some of the Best music came from UK back in the 60s 70s need to listen to more of it bro
3724,&#39;Sounds like angels.&#39;<br>Perfect analogy.👍
3725,"The amount of overdubs on this song are legendary. And being that the technology was much different then, they (or I should say &#39;he&#39; as in Freddie Mercury) were constantly adding tracks to the existing tape. So much so that the tape wore so thin that the whole track was in jeopardy of being lost had the tape snapped."
3726,Keep doing Queen I’m living for it
3727,The intro was actually just the one singer. He recorded each harmony 5 times over
3728,Has he done stairway to heaven?
3729,Thank you for opening up your musical varieties! Now you can experience the genius that was and still is Freddy Mercury!

I&#39;m a Hip Hop head myself, but I knew about Queen from back in the day. Another one bites the dust, Radio gaga, Under pressure, Hammer to Fall, We are the champions, crazy little thing called love etc...they were tough!!!"
3773,First heard this in about 1979 of course it blew my mind. Great music we had back then.<br>Saddest song you&#39;ll ever hear.
3774,Now you just need to go and watch the movie about Freddie and the band... Bohemian Rhapsody! It&#39;s incredible

3815,"Dude, try Closer to the edge by Yes. It&#39;s freaky."

3821,Omg please do &quot;lair&quot; by Queen awesome u will love it
3822,He is talking about killing his old self to be his true self. Freddie Fucking Mercury one of the best vocalist of all time! This is more of a Rock Opera was f you watch the documentary on them you see how fucking amazing it was putting this song together.
3823,My favorite line is : &quot;These boys came from a happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick?!&quot;  Lol. It&#39;s priceless. I watch this whenever I need a pick me up.
3824,It should be considered a sin to pause this song. Freddie Mercury was the very best at what he did. There will never be another like him.
3825,A lot have reacted to this but shaq is the best
3826,Lovin your vids! ... <br> (patiently waiting for a Frank Zappa reacton) :)
3827,Hahahaha! love it!
3828,"Hello...  great reaction.  This song came out when I was in high school so I am very old.  Freddie Mercury was an amazing talent.  His voice was pure joy and his song writing was stellar.  Brian May on lead guitar is a genius.  Literally, he has a PhD in Astrophysics.  The song is a rock OPERA.  That is why the music goes in and out of all the highs and lows.  The story, most importantly, is about when Freddie decided to come out of the closet and tell his Mum and the world, that he was gay.  Symbolically he put a gun to the head of the man his Mum and everyone else thought he was.  He struggles with all the difficult times he will experience but know he has to be true to who he was.  Sadly, Freddie died from AIDS in the early 90s.  He made a statement that he had AIDS and a few days later he was gone.  He was a genius but like all of us, we have struggles.  I am grateful God shared Freddie with the world before taking him home.  There will NEVER another Freddie Mercury.  Check out more of his videos.  There was a concert event in the 80s called LIVE AID, a benefit concert to feed the starving victims of famine in Africa.  This concert lasted 3 days.  Queen played for 70,000 people at Wembley Stadium in London.   There were simultaneous concerts on 3 continents all at the same time.  It was amazing.  I hope you enjoy more rock music.  It is my history.  ❤️"
3829,They can&#39;t be playing with me like that. LMFAO
3830,Rock opera
3831,&quot;A happy christmas morning to halloween real quick&quot;     lmao.  Ty for the smiles❤
3832,hands down everybody this is the best reaction i’ve ever seen.
3833,I sang this in choir in high school
3834,"See... I am always having to tell people that they need to listen to the actual lyrics of the song instead of the beats. There is a lot more meaning buried in real music than just the beats and the flow. Prime examples I can think of is Coolio&#39;s Ganster&#39;s Paradise, Afroman&#39;s Because I got High, and Pearl Jam&#39;s Last Kiss.. all songs that are misleading if you only follow the beats and flow without listening to the lyrics. This song, to me, falls along those lines."
3835,DUDE. Your facial reaction had me smashing the subscribe button instantly
3836,"I&#39;m dying hahahaha, you look scared!! Lmao"
3837,"Sunday morning in Australia and i have things to do.<br>However, i am watching you! <br>Little time waster that you are...but i love it.."
3838,I feel the same way when I hear it! Your so funny! I love listening to ya!!
3839,&quot;it went from happy Christmas to Halloween&quot; lol 😂 subbed immediately
3840,"I could totally be wrong about certain things, so chill out haters. Freddie Mercury, is an Indian (from India).   When he was 18 they moved to Middlesex England, which is where the band was formed, Queen. Mercury was known for having a 4 octave vocal range. The who&#39;s Roger Daltry said Mercury was the best virtuoso rock and roll singer of all time. Hes also listed in the top 100 best voices of all time. He had some messed up teeth, which he refused to have fixed because he was terrified it would change the way he sounded. He was a composer, so he wrote a Rock Opera, which took awhile for everybody to get their parts all right. But it was a masterpiece, because Freddie was a perfectionist. People said it wouldnt get airtime because it was too long.But everybody sure sings along today, so the radio must have gave in.  I  dont think he was a very happy person, partially due to the fact that he was a gay man living in the wrong decade.I think part of him felt like he was breaking moral codes, and his mamas heart. He was born and raised in a fifties type home, and I dont think he enjoyed letting his mom know too much.He even dated a girl who he loved, and he referred to her as his common law wife, they lived together 6 yrs. But she was by his side when he died He is definitely a classic rock god, but you could also consider him a classical rock god. Its a shame he died of AIDS, when now its curable. I would say he was classified as a prodigy, atleast me and alot of others think so too. Oh yeah great video Shaq, this is the 3rd one I&#39;ve seen, and I&#39;ve enjoyed your reviews."
3841,"Ah yes, the many tempo and style changes of Bohemian Rhapsody. This was my introduction to good music when I was a kid."
3842,"If you want a Queen song that can make you cry, try &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever.&quot;<br>It gets to me every time."
3843,I wanna do shit today yet here I am on video number 7
3844,Learn to listen
3845,I had to explain to my mom what this song is really about...😑😑

3851,These N*<b>**</b> is Bipolar.....lol
3852,"Many say the meaning of this song is Freddie coming &quot;out of the closet&quot;.  Killing himself to become himself and the struggle of doing so.   It makes sense to me, when I listen to the song with new ears, considering that possibility.  Queen was in my era, but I never paid much attention.  I can&#39;t get enough of them, now."
3853,You should react to guns and Rose&#39;s jungle

3869,"This song contains all music in one song... opera, rock etc"
3870,Songz about him dying from Aids Freddy Mercury lead singer died from Aids
3871,Rule number one when you are reviewing a piece of music. Keep your mouth shut and listen. Nobody is in the least bit interested in your manic shouting and stopping and starting the video. You are just a fucking irritant and a fucking raving nut case to boot. Find another pastime because you are fucking rubbish at this one.
3872,Nooooooo he paused midway through the solo😢
3873,"Freddie Mercury is still, to this day, one of the few singers that have ascended above all singers in all genres. He&#39;s a Legend. In fact, he&#39;s THE Legend.<br>You should react to &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; by Queen. Or &quot;Who Wants To Live Forever&quot; by Queen as well. Those songs are a bit more underrated compared to this song, but they show off Freddie&#39;s voice so much more. Plus they&#39;re just as fantastic."
3874,Freddie Mercury started dreaming about the melody in his dreams. He worked on three songs at the same and put them together and added opera to the rock ballad. Freddie is the greatest musician ever. Queen the greatest band.
3875,Can u just fucking okay the music or thing then talk after it’s fucking annoying
3876,This fucking made me lose my shit dying laughing hysterically 5 times. <br><br>Welcome to Queen bro!
3877,"I&#39;ve seen a hundred reactions to Bohemian Rhapsody, but this one is BY FAR the best 😂 I&#39;m laughing my ass off"
3878,Much respect for this reaction one of my all time favorite bands. You should do a reaction to JOURNEY “DON’T STOP BELIEVING”!!!
3879,Thank you Freddy!
3880,NO LO PAUSES ANIMAL!!!! dejalo correr

3883,Only the greatest singer of all time....Freddie Mercury.....died from aids.
3884,"Why is it SO FUN watching black guys react to queen songs, like honestly their reactions are fucking gold and they are so happy and that makes me happy"

3898,"Quick breakdown of this song:<br>It is the inner termoils of Freddie Mercury&#39;s life.  His struggle with being gay in a testosterone heavy industry during a time when being gay was a sin against society itself.  His struggle with drugs.  Etc.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s so bipolar... He had all these struggles, but there were moments of beauty and life too."
3899,LOL Shaqs reaction to the rhapsody part where there switch flows lol I love this guy Shaq you the best! 💕
3900,"Oh, by the way, prepare for an emotional roller-coaster"

3906,In 5th grade my teacher would play this every morning and while it was playing we were aloud to do what ever we wanted. It was crazy awesome fun everyone just dancing and running around the room. You can only imagine how much of a release it was for us all and a great way to start the school day. Youre a real one Mrs.Hunt! P.s.  that was like 2007 im 21 now
3907,"Haha!!  I loved your reaction to the opera part!!-- great!!  From a happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick  hahaha!!!  Brilliant!  Dude, you are the best!!"
3908,Funny how we used to be exactly the same but also opposites. I was a rock guy and always turned off Rap and hip hop until I really started to pay attention to it and realized I had been so close minded.  There&#39;s a lot of really good rap/hip hop artists ..... some of them insanely good lyricists.  Like when I was a kid I never payed any attention to Tears for Fears but then as an adult I heard their song Mad World and realized that omg those guys are master songwriters.  Now I pay more attention and don&#39;t turn any music away...as long as it makes me feel something then I&#39;m open to it.
3909,Freddie Mercury is one of the BEST vocalists EVER!!
3910,Long live Freddie Mercury 💔
3911,Dragonforce &quot;through the fire and the flames&quot;! Pleaseeeeeee please pleaseeeeeee!!!!!!

3918,WAYNE&#39;S WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love this song... it&#39;s like five songs in one... with some head banging thrown in for good measure!
3919,"Rip Freddy Mercury,  He wrote this song about himself."
3920,I can not stop laughing. You bring such joy to watch. I dig it
3921,React to the darkness growing on me.
3922,BEST FUCKING REACTION EVER.  Watched this at least 100 X.this Canadian loves you
3923,"My man, you need them wireless headphones"
3924,Freddie gave a man aids and so he wrote this song about it
3925,"Flawless song, and it&#39;s around 45yrs old!!<br><br>Btw, Freddy Mercury isn&#39;t from the UK. He&#39;s actually born in Tanzania, so he&#39;s S. African.."
3926,"Your reaction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m24s"">6:24</a> was priceless."
3927,"You should really watch the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, its a fantastic film I give a 10/10!"
3928,R.I.P Mr. Mercury!! One of the greatest artist of all time!! I know you probably did sum research after this video to see what this song was all about and his life.
3929,Dude I have not smiled this much at a reaction in a while.
3930,Freddie Mercury is one of the best vocalists in the history of vocalists. I never cease to be impressed by his vocals. And I’ve been a Queen fan most my life 😂😂
3931,Not sure if someone mentioned it but the song is apparently about him being gay in a time where coming out was almost impossible.<br>Clues: when you talked about killing a man it refers to the image that he had to portray. When he said sometimes he wished he wasnt born at all because it was so difficult. And even when Galileo was mentioned. An astronomer who was imprisoned in his home (essentially) because he made comment about earth revolving around the sun and the Church did not lile that. Freddie feels trapped because he is afraid of the backlash he would receive.
3932,"Shaq, Freddie Mercury was trained in classical voice and piano in India and further when his family moved to England. Freddie took a long time to write this and it is his version of a tragic mini-opera with a rock twist."
3933,"Holy Fuck Shaq, over 670,000 views of this video alone. You are hot on the reaction video scene. There is no limit to the rock world and you are just scratching the surface. We&#39;ll help you along, my friend. There are several thousand more to go!"
3934,So glad you expanded your musical horizons!!
3935,You love Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson?!!! Subscribed!
3936,"You hear queen every time you go to any sporting event!  We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions, both Queen!"
3937,"Please It&#39;s time for you to react a song from  the opera singer Montserrat Caballe&amp; Freddie Mercury &quot;Barcellona&quot; or &quot;The Golden Boy&quot; very beautiful songs,PLEASE  &lt;3  &lt;3  &lt;3 &lt;3 ,love from Venice Italy"
3938,Queen touches the soul
3939,Freddie mercury he died 1991 of aids
3940,Your the best man ....your face was priceless
3941,"Im a hip hop head and Ive listened to rock in the 90s but now cuz of you Im starting to listen to pre Black Album Metalica and suprisingly some Megadeth. As far as rap ill stop keepin up with it besides Nipsey, Future and Larry June. Im pretty done with new hip hop besides them...."
3942,If you havent seen the movie you need to it&#39;s a really great movie.
3943,Dude you liked Stevie Ray Vaughan you gotta check out Steven Vai HE&#39;S the greatest guitarist of all time!!!
3944,Freddy Mercury is considered as one of the greatest vocalist of all time!!
3945,"Don&#39;t fool me. Not once in your in your life have you ever heard this song? Please, you turned the radio off at the beginning? Come on, I thought this channel was fun, now I just think it&#39;s a joke. Tell me you heard it before, and you listen to it again for your channel, to really appreciate it and share your thoughts. Sincerely."
3946,It’s about the struggle with emotions when you do something wrong and you realize that you have to pay for it
3947,"Obviously, doesn’t understand the pain of a poor man on death row.<br>The song describes his feelings about going to hell.<br>Thus, Bohemian Rapsody"
3948,"Freddie Mercury, unfortunately died of AIDS"
3949,It’s a song about a death row inmate
3950,"Freddie: good bye everybody, I’ve got to go..<br><br><b>Shaq: hold up!</b><br><br>I’m crying yo 😂"
3951,Axel rose and Elton John preformed this song  at the Freddie mercury concert and they did a great job at it
3952,This was so strange and revolutionary when it first came out. It was like hearing a new genre of music. It was truly awe inspiring.
3953,I haven’t laughed this hard in years!
3954,I was hearing this song while I was still in the womb lol.
3955,Which planet did u live In? Lol
3956,"My Man “That’s Tuff”. This is the 2nd time I’m posting this. <br><br>IF THERE IS ANYONE OUT THERE THAT AGREES, PLEASE HELP! I’ve gone so far as to beg for a “Reaction”. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE LAYERS OF HARMONIES on, I’ll take it down to 2 songs not not including “Bohemian Rhapsody”. The 2 older songs are “Now I’m Here&quot; &amp; “The Prophets Song” have what you call “Panning” , in and out of each headphone. These early recordings were recorded B/S (before synthesizers) &amp; are more than amazing. I’ve only looked and SO MANY of your “Competitors” took my request themselves. I’m not interested to see them experience what Queen created for you. As in “Bohemian Rhapsody” there are layers upon layers of recording tape. THE ONLY MUST IS TO WEAR FULL EAR HEADPHONES. I’d never steer you wrong, EVER! <br><br>Sincerely, Terry Anne Fogarty <br><br>1980&#39;s Original Fat Bottom Girl from Old HB, NYC. (1978 the BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!!!)"

3962,The singer&#39;s name was Freddy Mercury may he rest in peace. This is their best song to me.
3963,"No he wasn’t living under a rock, he just heard the movie “Bohemian Rhapsody” was coming out, and was like “hey, I can get views!” Even though he’s most definitely heard of the song, or the band."
3964,Freddie Mercury

3997,"It’s a song like Bipolar (loved u saying that). It’s a mixture slow, soft, calm, starts speeding up, loud, out of control, almost reflects how life is. Ups, downs, soft, hard, quite, loud. It follows life. Your reaction I’m sure how is how I was first time hearing it. Never knew what to expect from this song...like life. Lol"
3998,your reaction to the to when it all turns rock is priceless ...ya even do the waynes world mosh
3999,No Life Shaq Queen has many famous songs that most may not even know who they are by. Like &quot;We Are The Champions&quot; &amp; &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. They play them like anthems at sporting events &amp; such. If you listened to them I&#39;m almost certain you would recognize them. Btw I love the fact that you not only go outside of what you already know but how you have embraced other genres. Music is a universal language! Also Freddie Mercury had ovtiv ranges most people don&#39;t have. He was truly a very gifted singer &amp; performer! Most of this song is Freddie&#39;s singing. All those crazy different ranges were just him! One person. It&#39;s layers of him singing.
4000,Trent reznor from nine inch nails or his solo album
4001,Listen to bicycle race by queen
4002,Freddy Mercury

4011,Just listen to the song without interrupting it!!! Geesh
4012,"&quot;Queen, y&#39;all are bipolar.&quot;  Genius."
4013,"OMG this was freaking hilarious! Loved this react. LMAO this video had me laughing more than when I saw this song on Wayne&#39;s World! Yeah, this song is like a short movie. It has a beginning to get you into the plot, then it begins working the listener to the climax and then ends with a nice gong. It is the quintessential rock anthem. These guys are all educated in music and the singer, Freddie Mercury, one of the best singers and performers in music, period. Not just rock but all music, may he rest in peace. The beauty of this song, it leaves the audience to interpret however the individual chooses. To however things are going in your life, the roller coaster you&#39;re on, Bohemian Rhapsody is the soundtrack that guides you on your journey."
4014,"Love your enthusiam, MAN!"
4015,"I love how you branch out and listen to other genres.<br><br>Even if you legit don’t like a genre.. often times the best music is made by the person who’s heard the most things.. even in hip hop.. if all you ever listen to is hip hop all your music is gonna sound like all the hip hop you’ve heard before. You won’t be original. Same applies to rock.. best rock stars are able to discuss hip hop, country, electronic.. all of it. They incorporate what they like and leave the rest."
4016,"&quot;yo queen, yall are bipolar&quot;      love it"

But Freddie couldn&#39;t take anymore when Michael also brought his Llama.<br><br>Michael Jackson also told Queen that they should make &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; another good Reaction video along with &quot;Dragon Attack&quot;.

4071,"&quot;Ready&quot; Freddie Mercury was one of the premier vocalists and best front men in rock history. This is a wonderful song, but for a glimpse into just how epic he truly was, you have to hear &quot;The show must go on.&quot; <br><br>His last recorded song, weak and dying from AIDS he could only record a few bars at a time without rest, and medicating himself. The guitarist, Brian May, was worried how he was going to hit the notes in the high part. Freddie looked at him, downed his vodka an said &quot;We&#39;ll just effing do it, darling...&quot; <br><br>He never got to preform &quot;The show must go on&quot; live. One of the first artists to come out publicly about them having AIDS back in the day, was/is rock royalty and a total legend."
4072,There is a story behind this song. The singer&#39;s name is Freddie Mercury. He died of complications from AIDS. This song is about that. Listen to the words. You will see the connection. He was formaerly an Opra singer. And was actually born in Zanzibar Africa.

4107,Freddy Mercury. Possibly the best male vocalist of all time.
4108,"I dont want to die but sometimes i wish id never born at all..,(tough lyrics)"
4109,"some of the greatest bands from the 60&#39;s, and 70&#39;s of course Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Queen, The Who, The Doors, Aerosmith, Heart, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Jimi Hendrix, CCR, The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Deep Purple, Cream, Bowie, Clapton, Van Halen, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, ZZ Top, Kiss, Rush, Bad Company, and so many others...and I actually was born in 1975 so most of the stuff I listened to was 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s music...my parents were only into country, and the oldies mostly, which I liked, but some of my older friends, as I got older got me into all these classic bands, and I&#39;m so glad they did...I mean I love the stuff from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s...but the classic ones are just unbelievable...I got to see Pink Floyd in concert  3 times, and they were the best I have ever seen, once was vip front row.....amazing and it was always the Wall my Favorite Album, even though it came from the 80&#39;s...I&#39;ve seen other concerts as well, but I will always remember Pink Floyd as being the best...I never got to see the older ones mostly because I was younger, and actually didn&#39;t start seeing any concert till my late 20&#39;s when I met my boyfriend, and he was older, and took me to a lot of them...saw Rush as well, which they were also great. He sees the Who  quite often still, he did back then, and of course now..I started having back problems, and had surgery, but still not to good, so now I can&#39;t really go  anymore which sucks, and my boyfriend even though older now, has played in bands all of his life, well since he was 18, just like cruise ships, casinos, bars and all that...he is a bass player, and also sings,  and he still does it, music is his life, so he also introduced me to bands I never knew of as well...which was definitely a good thing!"
4110,TED NUGENT real rock and roll
4111,"Freddie Fucking Mercury,  greatest rock vocalist of all time!"
4112,Michael Jackson and freddy from queen did a song together called there must be more to life x

4123,Listen to Nightwish.
4124,So it&#39;s theorized that this is Freddie&#39;s coming out song. &quot;Momma I killed a man.&quot; He killed his old self and now he&#39;s himself. He was raised in a conservative family so he was hiding who he really is.  There&#39;s a whole YouTube video about it.
4125,"Dude i love your vids, keep it up man !!"
4126,&quot;He can sing his ass off doe&quot; is literally the best possible way to describe Freddie Mercury.
4127,Who’s that lead singer? Hush your mouth. That’s Mr. Fahrenheit Freddie Mercury. If you want a roller coaster try The show must go on or Someone to love 1981 live in Montreal. He’s got a voice that is so sweet but can also bang it out. Enjoy the ride.
4128,Freddie mercury the GOAT
4129,That singers name is Freddie Mercury. One of the best singers of all time. He had an eight octave vocal range.
4130,Freddie Mercury is his name..
4131,If you like transitions try watching innuendo by queen that will think your tripping x
4132,"You think this is bipolar try watching the miracle that will mess with your head ,video brilliant message beautiful , music and vocals perfect x"
4133,He has a new favorite song
4134,That is Feddy Mercury singing. He died of aids and that is what the song reminds of. He doesn&#39;t want to die
4135,His secret life of being a famous gay man in the 70&#39;s was a roller coaster of love and loss. Sadly he died in the 90&#39;s of AIDS.
4136,The song is about him finding out he had aids and coming to terms with him knowing he was dying
4137,I love that he even knows this is a classic. Greatest song ever!
4138,"Strawberry Fields Forever by the Beatles, and for your headphones check out &quot;revolution 9&quot; by the Beatles as well"
4139,My man if u ever wanna test speakers or head phones this song hits every note from high to low.
4140,Lmfao .
4141,Freddie made Aids popular. This song is an amalgamation of many ideas freddie had. Still the most successful band in history imo. Watch their live show in Rio its incredable.
4142,If you don’t have merch yet. Specifically a shirt that says “That is tough!”. What’s going on lol?!

4151,Their album was called ‘A Night At The Opera’. And this some is very operatic. It tells a story from start to finish. Brilliant!
4152,Back when radio had dynamics.
4153,"Hilarious reaction mate, loving the different genre reactions"
4154,"It took me years of hearing it before I actually thought about the lyrics. But to me, each transition is a new act in a play. Act 1: Overture, Act 2: He confesses to his mom about the murder and says he&#39;s going to turn himself in. Act 3: The trial. His friends and family plead for his life, the jury / judge has no mercy, he gets life in prison. Act 4: He&#39;s in prison now and raging against his situation. And, finally, the outro--he&#39;s resigned himself to the situation. My two cents / interpretation anyway. But it&#39;s an awesome piece."
4155,marc martel did song for the movie...maybe you can do a reaction of him?
4156,The truth!

4199,Bohemian Raphsody is the greatest song of all time. Nothing tops this.
4200,React to queen live aid
4201,"It&#39;s called an opera. A style of music that utilizes several switching melodies, rhythm&#39;s and chore&#39;s to convey a single message or meaning. Welcome to the pinnacle of musical evolution. You are centuries worth of evolution behind."
4202,"Shaq you are Killing it dude! I really need a laugh at the end of the day, but I know it is more than that to you. It really does show that you are having a great time discovering new types of music. Although I know you are having fun but also just being yurself. Keep it real and rock on Steelers!! God bless and take care"
4203,"Okay, Queen. Ever heard of The Kings? They are a Canadian band from the 80&#39;s and beyond. Here is their best, most iconic selection. It is still played every Friday at 5:00 P.M. in Cleveland as sort of a &quot;kick off the weekend&quot; song. if you haven&#39;t heard it...listen and enjoy!"

Most reactors focus on nonsense &amp; do not get nuanced, meaning &amp; messages! That is what music of my generation is all about! Love your delight in listening &amp; glad that you got to hear this iconic band! Don&#39;t worry, Queen is not trying to &quot;play&quot; with you! They are just masters of music! Your word &quot;Wow&quot; says it all! Thanks for reacting &amp; feeling something when listening to  Bohemian Rhapsody! Freddie wrote it &amp; you must agree he was not only a great singer, but a genius! Thanks for your reaction--I am still laughing with you!!!"
4205,"No Life Shaq this album is considered a rock opera and the song was meant to send you through high and lows ,happiness and sadness . it was written shortly after Freddy Mercury (singer) found out he had aids.Also every member of the band have degrees.Freddy had a aa in arts,Brian May(guitarist) has several different degrees."
4206,Bohemian Rhapsody is like a musical roller coaster ride!

4222,Been watching a few videos and you keep saying the sound goes in one ear then out the other and back again.... my friend welcome to the effect known as the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s reverb.
4223,Time for you to listen to Queen at &#39;Live Aid 1985&#39; for the greatest live performance by any band of the 20th Century!
4224,Really?
4225,Love you man...you are getting our music out there. Thank you
4226,"Your reactions are educational.  Its interesting.  I never thought about this song like this, yet all the while i realize now, for the lat 30 years, thats what its been doing to me, in the back of my head.  Holy crap!!   So having you, someone who apparently didnt grow up around this stuff, to see it as an intelligent adult for the first time, without having already been desensitized to it, is really what your recipe is here. Dont stop it!  its great, its very educational.  <br><br>When i say educational, im not kidding, when you have a life changing pink floyd moment in one way, im having one in another, e.g. if it impacts him(you) that much, where the heck has my head been.  So good stuff, yeah!  <br><br>Those guys are artist, Queen, so it might help to remember, art goes in every which way naturally. There is no rules, there no patterns, only things these bands share with us, like glimpses in time, it was somebodies reality at one point, or else there is one reality, on paper, when its written, then you get world class musicians who are also incindencally actors, and you get these masterpieces, on many layers.  <br><br>Still pink floyd, or &quot;No Quarter&quot; Zep, now that&#39;s music.  Like, i dont even listen to it(rock) much any more, it just is good to see it in a new light, and brings back all the memories of where we want to be, younger right? back before the world reared its ugly head.  <br><br>So bro, sending some love, you got some good stuff. Im only old school rap, so not sure i can even watch more than the rock 10% of your stuff, do some EDM maybe?<br><br>So yeah, keep up the good work, peace out!"
4227,The one and only &quot;Freddie Mercury&quot;
4228,"Shaq Freddie Mercury made this song to touch on multiple genres of music classical music, soft rock, opera, heavy rock. This song was never played on the radio until years after Freddie Mercury passed away. They made a movie about this band named Bohemian Rhapsody YOU NEED TO WATCH THAT MOVIE!!"

4232,Freddy Mercury was before his time. Awesome vocals.
4233,omg i laughed too hard at this
4234,That my friend is what is called a rock opera. Bands like that do now exist anymore. Like you said you went through all these different emotions. Only great music can do that to you.

4245,What the fuck is going on???? Lmao
4246,"It&#39;s called a ballad.  Rock-n-Roll covers a wide span of beats, notes, and lyrics.  If 60,000 people will sing it at the same time, it&#39;s not something to overlook.  Proof positive:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp7j3ji5U24&amp;feature=share"

4252,I think you might be my most favorite thing on the internet. I can&#39;t help but grin whenever I watch you. 😁
4253,You should do kiss from the 80s
4254,Freddie Mercury dies of AIDS. That is the gun he pulled the trigger on
4255,A little context for you.<br><br>Freddie mercury (the vocalist) was a gay man. And one of the very first high profile cases of the early aids pandemic of the 70s and 80s. When he sings about killing a man he&#39;s talking about him spreading aids to others unknowingly and literally giving them the same death sentence as him. The majority of the song is written like a fair well to his family and mother asking for them to let him go.<br><br>Reminds me that we all have a debit to the reaper and weather we go out in blaze or in a whimper we go out either way. <br><br>He lived with the disease for over 15 years but died in the late eighties or early nineties (I can&#39;t recall exact). <br><br>He is regarded as the best rock singer of all time
4256,"You never seent waynes world? Btw I can&#39;t stop watching your videos, much love. Keep doing what you doing son!"

4267,In the very beginning it&#39;s only Freddie&#39;s voice dubbed made to sound like 4
4268,Do a reaction to queen at live aid. It will blow your mind
4269,The beginning of song is not all 4 members.  It is Freddie Mercury singing it in 4 different vocals mixed together.  No one knows the true meaning of song but it was believed to be Freddie coming out as gay.  The killing of a man is believed to be Freddie killing the straight man he had on outside.
4270,A Night at the Opera was the first rock albim I ever listen to and it is still the best.....Shaq you got to listen to it.
4271,Really? The only song I like from Queen is &quot; another one bites the dust!&quot; It&#39;s more like theatre music 😷😫👎
4272,"Queen exemplified the true potential of the genre. <br>They were the modern day Bach, Beethoven, Vivaldi etc."
4273,What I would give to spend an afternoon with this guy smoking weed and listening to all kinds of musical genres. This cat is living life....

4276,Freddie Mercury is his name...fabulous video bro hahaha
4277,the best rection man! keep it up..
4278,Everybody loves &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; but nobody pays attention another great Queen song on the same album called &quot;The Prophet Song.&quot;  That&#39;s the song that truly shows how talented Queen was at just using their voices and nothing else. It&#39;s really like nothing I&#39;ve ever heard before or since.
4279,freddie might be the closest humanity has ever gotten to an angel on earth
4280,The most fake/ staged reaction videos
4281,Fucking kidding me man??? It&#39;s Freddy Damn Mercury! Can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve never heard of him before. It&#39;s like not knowing MJ even if you ain&#39;t into pop music.

4284,It you like movie soundtracks    that is classical music  with over 100 people making love  with a giant range of instruments  that&#39;s is  awesome as shit
4285,Classical music is so amazing  to go music hall  Cincinnati  get your mind blown
4286,Classical music  is definitely an aquired taste   you either love it or hate it. But you have to respect  it.   Mozart Beethoven Bach  it is what it is
4287,Complete masterpiece of rock mixing rock with opera  I don&#39;t like straight up opera  but love classical  music
4288,Your reaction is superb)   FREDDIE - Legend
4289,Lauren Hill did a cover of this...if you wanna hear it with a hip hop feel.
4290,"at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=5m15s"">5:15</a>.....dude talkin bout he has only kinda heard the song but changed the station. He started the &quot;OOooooooohhhh&quot; before Freddie did. We all know damn well that this is one of his guilty pleasures as we all have. Mine you ask??? I&#39;m a construction worker but I nail every single one of Jewels notes when I&#39;m in my work truck by myself....."
4291,He can sang his ass off tho - Shaq    Now that&#39;s the truest true I ever knew. PS that cam mic is blown the fuck out.
4292,"There’s the story that he signed his soul to the devil and he was the man that put a gun to his head....put that thought in your head then re-listen. Illuminati, symbols on albums, etc..."
4293,Shaq.   You&#39;re so refreshing.  Your reactions are so entertaining because they are sincere.
4294,You need to review Queen at Live Aid 1985
4295,&quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?&quot; Lost my shit. 😂
4296,That song has all  genre of music
4297,every time he hits stop i die on the inside
4298,Bohemian Rhapsody is a rock opera it&#39;s the first one ever any other band has ever done and Freddie Mercury is a god when it comes to the singing
4299,😂😂😂 &quot;What the fuck is going on!?&quot; You had me dying. Lol
4300,Rollercoaster. That&#39;s exactly what I think this song is. This song is the perfect example of a musical rollercoaster.
4301,Listen to Fat Bottomed Girls by Queen lol
4302,"Dude, the man he killed was himself, to his mother. He came out of the closet.  Now think about the song."
4303,This song is based on a solider in Vietnam.  True story
4304,"U r funny I&#39;m dying laughing! I can understand why you have over 550,000 subs!  Thanks for the content!"
4305,Freddie Mercury the lead singer of Queen died from aids in the beginning of the song when he says mama I just killed a man put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead from what I understand he&#39;s referring to the AIDS epidemic and he was a victim of aids . He chose men over women therefore he was a gay man but extremely talented
4306,"“I don’t know whether to throw my phone at my mama, or call her and tell her ‘I love you’”. 😂😂😂"
4307,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m10s"">3:10</a> A balloon deflates and flies around the room lol"

4314,Got me saying &quot;slow it down coach&quot; at work...<br>And referring to guys at work. &quot;myguy&quot;
4315,Not sure if mentioned here by anyone but Freddie Mercury died of AIDS. It is theorized the song is about this. Now go listen to the lyrics again. &quot;Put a gun against his head. Pulled the trigger now he&#39;s dead.&quot;
4316,It is said that Freddy was speaking about accepting that he was gay. The song is the death of a heterosexual man accepting the homosexual man that he was.

4323,Lead singer Freddy Mercury of Queen  sang this song about his homosexuality and contracting HIV which he later died from in the late 80&#39;s. It was his coming out song of the emotional rollercoaster he was dealing with knowing he was going to die from this sexually transmitted disease.

4369,Loved your reaction to this as well. This is an awesome song. They were/are musical geniuses. Freddie Mercury was raised listening to Opera by his mother. His voice is so powerful. This song  (and some others) was like a mini opera. 3 or so songs put together to tell a story. Its truly amazing.
4370,His first time listening to Greatness !!!!!
4371,"Freddy is singing about himself and how he died inside because he was born gay. This song IS about him, he wants to be saved from it but in the end it doesnt really matter. Listen closely. great song."

4384,"You probably know this by now, but this was the first ever &quot;rock video&quot; that was dramatic rather than just the band playing."

4410,I like to see him react to some KISS.
4411,"Ok Shaq, idk if anybody has told you, or if you researched it. Freddie had AIDS, this song is literally about him dying. He had a haaaaaaaard life, treated like shit because he was gay, not to mention his emotional spectrum because he was so emotionally intelligent and a music genius. &quot;Easy come easy go will you please let me go&quot; pretty much begging to be cured and asking &#39;why me.&#39; There were times he could barely stand on stage because he was so weak. He never quit. He loved everyone. He only wanted to <b>live</b> ....that&#39;s it, and it was ripped away from him. I always listened to this song and loved it. But now, I <b>listen</b> to this song and just apply what I know about him and his situation and have soooo much respect."

4464,"FYI Coach - this song is a mixture of 3 incomplete songs that Freddy Mercury wanted to put together. He was encouraged NOT TO.. but... as you can see, the man is a MASTER. We discussed this in music class. The difficulty in transitions, notes and melody is unbelievable."
4465,"Many of this generation do not know what/who QUEEN is until the movie came out. One of my daughter&#39;s boyfriends claim he knew music... and I asked him about Queen, he said, &quot;Who&quot;.

4476,Freddie Mercury is the singer and he is one of the greatest musicians of all time he could go from singing in a rock band to doing dance track&#39;s he even collaborated with an opera singer and Michael Jackson.

4486,Lead singer Freddie Mercury
4487,It&#39;s a mock opera. 3cheers from Canada
4488,"The transitions are known as a rhapsody.  If you listen to some Orchestral music, it&#39;s basically ADHD Dubstep before computers sequenced it.<br>Lots of changes, it&#39;s very hard to make the transitions, and listening to it is like learning to appreciate an IPA beer, it&#39;s not easy but the more one understands how hard it is the easier it is to appreciate it."
4489,"They&#39;re actually headphones and it&#39;s a result of multiple different mixings of the music. The lead singer&#39;s name is Freddie Mercury and the lead guitar player, Brian May, his father made that guitar for him. Pull up your britches and hang on! It took them a really long time to record this song because Freddie Mercury was so particular about everything! He wound up dying of AIDS however."
4490,Queen is my heart. My fav band everrrrrrrr 💖
4491,"Lmao, I don’t know if I want to throw my phone at my mama or call my momma"

4513,"The singer is Freddie Mercury and you were very correct in one thing you said towards the front of the video. One of the singers, Freddie, is now, in fact, an angel. A tremendous loss of possibly the greatest voice in the history of rock."
4514,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=4m35s"">4:35</a> “doesn’t really sound like rock right now” ....just wait buddy"

4524,Best written Mini Opera in the last 150 years...
4525,7.48 maybe the most genuine surprised wtf I&#39;ve heard😂😂
4526,"Queen was my very first concert ...The Forum in LA...1982. I was 14 and a hot, southern California Beach Blonde...out with Marines way too old for me(married one of them years later)...but one of the best nights of my life. Freddie Mercury was so hot!!! and he had a way of making you part of the show...like he knew you were there! I miss him!!!!"
4527,WTF was that indeed!? Was it rock? Metal? Ballad? A roller coaster it was! And so underrated.... took years to catch on..... even for me as a Queen fan.... But it became my favorite eventually.

4536,"Just found you, 60 yr white male , I remember when I discovered that all music has great , try pink Floyd , time"
4537,The beauty of Bohemian Rhapsody.  So many think its a song with all these different meanings and the band always claimed there is no meaning.  Freddie Mercury was a beast.  He had a voice like no one else for sure.
4538,Your reaction to Queen.  ...priceless!!!
4539,Lmfao this man said : how’s he gonna say the most brutal thing and sound like an angel lol!!!!

4545,My dude this is the song he made about him catching Aids listen to it again now you know that
4546,Lead singer is Freddie mercury (might of spelled his last name wrong)
4547,"This is a rock song but it’s actually four songs combined into one and the producer didn’t want to release it but Freddie insisted. Original was 10 minutes long and they shortened it to six minutes. To get it on the radio, The guys went to a DJ named, Kenny, in London. He played the song 14 times in a weekend and it took off! It was a number one in the UK for about nine or 10 weeks. It went to number one again in 1991 with Wayne’s world. This song gets CRAZY!!! It’s an intro plus of Boward and this operatic song and then the rock. It’s crazy wild but Beautiful and genius"
4548,"The opening harmony to that song it’s only Freddie Mercury. He made several tracks in different harmonics and combined them together to sound like several people, but it was just Freddie Mercury at the beginning. After his piano vocal then the other members were singing with him in harmonica"
4549,"the singer is freddy mercury peace rest his soul, true rock god"
4550,Bro I fuckin Love your reaction man..you are a legend when it comes to reaction video😂😂😂
4551,"Have you heard Fat Bottom Girls? If not , try that one."
4552,lol
4553,I&#39;m happy you found queen my man. My wife hated queen for years. It was only until about six years ago that I made her watch them in live aid on YouTube with me that she learned to appreciate them. Now when they come on the radio the volume goes up baby
4554,Lead singer Freddie Mercury. <br>Dead. Very talented 👍
4555,I wunder if you keep listening to this song since you heard this

4559,"You compare Freddy Mercury to Michael Jackson a lot. Which I agree. Major rocker myself but lots of love for MJ. You should check out rock covers of the King of Pop&#39;s songs. 2 stick out, Smooth Criminal by Alien Ant Farm and Dirty Diana by Shaman&#39;s Harvest."
4560,"Their genre is unique.  It’s kind of rock opera, and nobody can touch it."
4561,Bro I havent laughed this hard in a min 🤣🤣🤣 thanks man lol
4562,"Him: What the fuck is going on!? <br><br>Us: No clue, we just roll with it. 😂"

4572,"Big up you expanding musical horizons brother, sup from Johannesburg, South Africa. From an Mlungu. :) (look it up) lol"
4573,You have witnessed the music genius of Freddy Mercury...
4574,&quot;Mama I just kill man&quot; means that he was a normal guy until he realized that he is gay n he burried his manlyhood. That&#39;s what he meant.
4575,So you listened to music for the first time?
4576,"Freddy Mercury was an all time star, check out Live Aid! Queen took over the whole show....Freddy’s story is amazing and he was a brilliant man beyond his years...he died too soon...he was bisexual and it’s been said that the words in bohemian rhapsody scream out Freddy’s inner demons at that time....I’m a lot older than you and Queen left great memories in my life as a young adult at the time in my 20s...I’m 58 now...miss you Freddy"
4577,It was late at night when our local rock station KY102 premiered &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;....it blew my mind! I knew I had never heard anything like Queen before. Masterful work there!
4578,Do meatloaf - I would do anything for love ( but I won&#39;t do that )
4579,I used to LOVE seeing Queen on VH1 and MTV back in the day. When they actually played music. Real music.
4580,The lead singers name was Freddy Mercury
4581,"Not Angels bro, Fairies... oops!! lmmfao"
4582,The man he killed was himself - when he came out as a bisexual - he was afraid he was compromising himself and losing himself to the world ! This is a testament to himself and his self-image.
4583,Boy that&#39;s Freddie Mercury son... Get up
4584,"Have you ever listen to Queen,on WEED?lol"
4585,Ahhh this takes me back to my high school days. Love Freddie forever.

4615,Arguably the greatest singer of all time
4616,This song is about his fight with Aids. Put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead. Now what do you think his gun is ? This song is deep and so sad.

4676,I haven&#39;t been through all your stuff but if you want to shred your brain to some queen you need to listen to SHEER HEART ATTACK!!!!!!!!  That is one of their heavy rock blow your mind songs.  It will kick you in the face and not stop till the end.  Please you NEED to do this song.
4677,Even God watched then looked at his angels n said “y’all are weak”.
4678,"Queen is not a rock band. They are true artists, all 4 of them. They performed ALL styles of music. No boundaries existed for them."
4679,"I didnt read the 5k comments, so I hope someone told you he died of AIDS and thats what this song was about... &quot;I jus killed a man. Pulled my trigger, now hes dead.&quot;<br><br>FRED MERCURY is a name I have told my children they BETTER know for LIFE!!"
4680,"NoLifeShaq..To REALLY enjoy Bohemian Rhapsody, supposedly this is the song Freddy Mercury wrote when he was diagnosed with Aids &amp; knew he was going to die. He&#39;s singing the song about himself. &#39;Momma, I don&#39;t wanna die...&#39;"

4687,"Shaq.... I just subscribed and loving your channel bro! Let me give ya a little backdrop on this song, since i know you like your facts and it actually makes this song intensely sad. Freddy Mercury (lead singer) was diagnosed w aids via homosexuality. He knew he was dying and sang till the end. Also, he is one of very, very few rock singers to ever sing professional opera. His voice was that good!"
4688,"Dogg your reactions are entertaining as hell, best on youtube.  Keep doing your thing!!!"
4689,Check out Pink Floyd Dark Side Of The Moon. The whole album.

4691,Man do I love watching you do reaction vids! You are straight up Lit

4751,Unpopular opinion but I prefer the puscifer version of this song but I definitely appreciate and respect the original
4752,"Just turned on to you and its great to see and hear someone widening their horizon&#39;s in music which also adds on to widening their view on life. Freddy was a very versatile musician and it seems always had that classical theme burning inside him.<br>Try listening to Barcelona to see and hear him achieve this goal: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASJI6pNGqGo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASJI6pNGqGo</a>  there&#39;s quite a few: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wdxj8-mAU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0wdxj8-mAU</a> such a waste. I&#39;m 70 years old, play lead guitar in a Rock &amp; Soul Band and have always had a wide taste in music so give it a go. Another guy to listen to if you like guitarists is the amazingly talented Johnny Hiland who is a master of it all country, rock etc just amazing: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S3gB6afBm0"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S3gB6afBm0</a><br>Cheers for now."

4759,That sweatshirt tho. I need that
4760,This song is a last thank you to finding out he was dying of aids in the 80s. RIP Freddy. All about context. New horizons.
4761,"This song messes me up emotionally every time I hear it. I&#39;m a huge Queen fan. And there are a ton of good songs by them (some are corny and not so good, but that&#39;s the same with any group). You like the Platters by any chance? Queen&#39;s singer, Freddie Mercury, does a really good cover of Great Pretender: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLRjFWDGs1g"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLRjFWDGs1g</a>"

It&#39;s telling a story...I cant remember the exact details but It&#39;s basically telling the story of a boy who kills a man, goes on trial, escapes the court room while receiving his sentence and goes out in a blaze of glory.

One of the few people blessed with true musical understanding and so they were able to create emotion invoking pieces of sound."

5037,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=4m20s"">4:20</a> - To answer your question, his name is Freddie Mercury. Born Farrokh Bulsara, he is Parsi-Indian-British. Vocal range is reported to be 4 octaves, pretty high for a rock singer of his caliber. Aside from his majestic voice, he is also known for his call-and-response during concerts. If you want to see him at his absolute best, I suggest you react to their gig at LIVE AID. Trust me, you will be AMAZED!"
5038,"THE BEST REACTION,PERIOD"
5039,Nice reaction Shaq
5040,"Best. Reaction. To. This. Song  EVER! It&#39;s been so much a part of my life, I loved seeing the reaction of someone who has never heard it."

5052,A legend Freddie Mercury
5053,"Gidday, Freddy Mercury came from a conservative Anglo - Indian family from Madagascar. Telling his mother that he is gay, is the same as telling her, he is a murderer.There is a reason the band is called &quot;Queen&quot; and not &quot;Macho&quot;."
5054,PLEASE live aide and somebody to love Montreal live. You would be BLOWN AWAY!!!
5055,Que pedazo de pelotudo que sos brother 🎸

5060,Only Shaq could get people turned up at the club for Queen! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
5061,Pentatonix is an acapella group- no instrument watch their cover of this song. Every thing is done only by their vocals
5062,OMG!! Fantastic reaction💕💕💕
5063,His name was Freddie Mercury he passed away some time ago from Aids or Aids related illness if I`m not mistaken.
5064,This is also reason why the standard for modern music videos is so high.

5083,“Turn up” 😂
5084,This is the reaction I didn&#39;t know I needed

5208,GO BUCKS
5209,To call Queen a rock band is the understatement of the century... they were artists and revolutionary for their time. Now that you&#39;ve heard them you should do a little research on them.
5210,I know it doesn&#39;t sound like  rock because it is a mix between rock and opera

5233,He wanted to write a story with this song and he based his lyrics and storytelling from opera and that&#39;s why the song is very bi-polar. 😊😊😊😊 one of the best songs ever made. Also they had really bad reception for the song but it became a cult classic so screw the haters.
5234,Freddie  Mercury the best rockstar ever. Loved your video and watching a new generation of Queen fans

Now, I grew up in the 80s but listen to every type of music,  I&#39;m really surprised you haven&#39;t reacted to the legend prince? Very underrated guitar and piano god, a vocal range that Michael or freddy couldn&#39;t touch and the swag! He is in my opinion the GOAT when it comes to all around musician. Watch prince blues guitar and cream live acoustic for his guitar skills and watch the most beautiful girl in the world and adore for his vocal range.  You might even play it for your wife! RIP prince,  you gotta do it shaq! He&#39;s a legend!"

5265,I love the reaction
5266,"The lead - of course is Freddie Fucking Mercury! This commentary video would have been SO much better if the Queen video didn&#39;t stop and start. Freddie Mercury is a boss... a Legend, and I see that you got that loud and clear.

5279,Great Reaction!   Very entertaining.  Check out Queen&#39;s Death on Two Legs... the lyrics are brutal - research what it&#39;s about first.
5280,Shoutout to the bucks lid 👌🏼
5281,The late Freddie Mercury
5282,Queen is awesome!  Love your reaction!  Check out Somebody To Love- first the official video and then the live version at Montreal ‘81!  Queen is so diverse.  At one one point you’ll have to check out ‘mAnother One Bites The Dust- it’s pure funk!
5283,I love your reaction to Queen.  I’ve loved these guys for many years and they always surprise me.   I recommend  reacting  to The Prophets Song and March of the Black Queen - both studio versions.  Cheers from Australia. 🇦🇺
5284,Fat Bottom Girls!
5285,A happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick... Priceless 😂
5286,GANGSTA!!!
5287,I bet your not gonna change the station next time it comes on. I seen you doing some air guitar.<br>Queen is a multi platinum recording group. <br>At least when Freddie Mercury was alive and singing
5288,gotta love the epic mixture that is rock and opera!
5289,Im loving the fact that you’re so into these British bands (Queen and Sabbath). You should listen to the Trooper by Iron Maiden if you dig this sorta shit.
5290,One of the most famous songs ever written - so just listen to the song  and do not over react.  Typical American having to go over the top when listen to song you have never listen before.  This song is not outrageous - you are!
5291,Your awesome lol I love your reactions <br>I grew up in the 80s <br>Freddy was a god then and a god now <br>Queen forever
5292,Just found your channel. I’m 6 videos in. I am in the vortex! Keep doing your thing! - go watch Bohemian Rhapsody right now!

5297,Best reaction video I have seen!

5299,"Please please, react to Crosby, Stills and Nash &quot;Suite Judy Blue Eyes&quot; for the same type of changes.<br>*"

5302,Do PinkFloyd - Echoes Live at Pompeii
5303,"Well the meaning of &quot; mama just killed a man, put the gun in his head, pulled the trigger now he&#39;s dead &quot; is referring to himself, the old Freddie. He confessed that he is gay."
5304,“They sound like angels”<br>Yes. Yes they do.

5315,I peed my pants when you said you felt like a punk and a gangster.<br>You are sooo funny. You are the best reaction ever to this song!!!!
5316,Awesome reaction of Queen..Thanks for sharing!!
5317,Freddy Mercury was singing every line it was edited to be that way even that super high note where it sounded like he was a woman. Fun fact-they were all being classically trained at a very expensive music college and saw each other and say hey man you wanna form a band I&#39;m tired of this college stuff so they all said yes and became Queen.
5318,Freddy is referring to his homosexuality the man he killed was straight self
5319,&quot;There it go! Woah!.... UH-PBBBBBTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHBPHBPRBPRH&quot; - No Life Shaq
5320,Apparently there is a whole sub-section of YouTube dedicated to Black people listed to Bohemian Rhapsody.
5321,Freddie Mercury had the voice of an angel and is the best frontman in rock history
5322,"Your reactions actually look very genuine, and I actually like it xD and I don&#39;t really like reaction YouTube channels lol, but I subbed cause you actually pay attention to the lyrics and just looks genuine."
5323,"SUBE UN VIDEO CON TU REACCION A <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No-AAzcc_A0"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No-AAzcc_A0</a>! ERES SUPER EXPRESIVO COMPADRE! M CAISTE A TODA M......!!!!"
5324,Your reaction is the reason they got famous. They were doing things no one has done and making sounds and rhythms people where hearing for the first time.
5325,"Yes, you need to react to their Live Aid set please!"
5326,This was exactly my reaction when I first hear this song.
5327,"You wanna see something that&#39;s a real f*cking trip, now go watch a band called &#39;Hayseed Dixie&#39; do this whole song in &#39;bluegrass&#39; form, you&#39;ll probably fall out your chair (:<br>It&#39;s too damn funny. Cheers and &#39;thumbs up&#39; !"
5328,&quot;Idk if i wanna throw my phone at my momma or call her n tell her i love her&quot;. <br>-nolifeshaq<br>Lmao!!!!!!

5330,one word &quot;LEGENDARY&quot;
5331,Now go watch the movie that cane out haha!
5332,its the biggest song ever recorded
5333,You should listen to &quot;Innuendo&quot; by Queen!
5334,"&quot;Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead&quot;...<br>&#39;How can he say something so brutal in a sweet and nice way?&#39;<br>~ Well that&#39;s freddie mercury for you!"
5335,"That band is queen. They made loads of hits in the 80s, 70s, and 90s. All of them are legends but Freddie Mercury was the best of all. He unfortunately passed away on the 24 of November 1991 due to pneumonia caused by aids, however they are still relevant today, with their lead singer, Adam lambert. Their songs consist of <br>1. Bohemian Rhapsody <br>2. Another one bites the dust <br>3. We will rock you<br>4. We are the champions <br>5. Killer queen <br>6. Somebody to love<br>7. Love of my life<br>8. Bicycle race<br>9. I’m going slightly mad<br>10. Innuendo <br>Roger Taylor (drummer) and Brian may (guitarist) were previously in a band called smile with their lead singer, Tim staffell. Tim quit the band because he was annoyed that the band wasn’t getting anywhere and that they were only doing college gigs. Freddie Mercury was then chosen for he role of the new lead singer, and re-named he band queen. And thank god he did. Shortly after, John deacon joined as the new bass guitarist. As I said, they made loads of hits. But thank GOD Tim left smile, ( no Shade to Tim but... yeah)"
5336,Wish I could like this vid a hundred times.
5337,"whether you react to this or not, one of the coolest videos I&#39;ve ever seen.  Gives me chills every time.  A gigantic crows sings this song while waiting for a band to come on stage <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnBNuqqz5g"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnBNuqqz5g</a>"
5338,this is so fake
5339,"You pause the video too often, you don&#39;t pause the video when Brian May is in the middle of a solo lol"
5340,Omg u gotta try under pressure hammer to fall radio gaga so many greats
5341,Haha we reacted the same in the 70s but loved it :)
5342,"The singer is Freddie mercury , he got diagnosed with AIDS , he was also bisexual , he died in 1991 bc of AIDS , and he was a legend💚💚"
5343,Freddy mercury is the singer
5344,"dude he didnt say  it nicely, its not about him killing a man  but himself by getting aids"
5345,let the songs play so u get the story instead of stopping every time they  get started
5346,At least this guy admitted to have Heard this song many times in the radio ... unlike other react channels that said I never heard this song...whenever I hear that I just block the fake fuckers ...<br>Keep it up!!!
5347,&quot;y&#39;all are bipolar&quot; funniest reaction ever.
5348,When the rock portion comes on and you lose it is just priceless. The best reaction vid I’ve ever seen. Welcome to Rock Opera Shaq!
5349,I wish I could experience this song for the first time. Great reaction bro.
5350,"I have to say I&#39;m a 67 yr old mum from Liverpool uk ,and I have never laughed so much as I did to your reaction to bohemian rhapsody , so funny , but it&#39;s a masterpiece good luck ."
5351,BULLSHIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTT
5352,Freddie Mercury genius like him nobody else
5353,"Shaq, you may like fat bottom girls."
5354,Please React to &quot;Play the Game&quot; by Queen. A music video uploaded by Queen Official. Thank you.
5355,"I cant stop crying  , just thinking about the lyrics ....."
5356,Esta re duro jajaja
5357,This song give me chills omg🙌🏼
5358,Fat bottom girls - queen
5359,"You should watch the video , the miracle that will certainly confuse you lol ."
5360,Where you been i grew up with hip hop but i also listened to all different artist  queen is what u call real talent.  hip hop today all sounds like mumble jumble
5361,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=1m35s"">1:35</a>  Best Queen-comment ever! &quot;Am i trippin&#39; or dees N*<b>**</b> sound like Angels&quot; xDD"
5362,I wish the remaining Queen members could see this reaction video...he said the song started out as a &quot;Happy Christmas morning and turned into Halloween real quick!!&quot; 😂😂😂
5363,The Coach at it&#39;s Best!!  Love it every Time u say  &quot;...am i trippin o what...&quot;
5364,Yo I’m crying 😂😂😂😂 you def got my sub
5365,Freddie Mercury  and he was bi and had HIV and i do believe this song was about that bit i could be wrong
5366,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m08s"">3:08</a> Your reaction when he says he killed a man lmao 🤣"
5367,"Glad to know uhav discovered QUEEN at last, now keep growing bro😊"
5368,"By the way he died from AIDS, it is really sad to listen to him when he basically says he was told he was going to die and it sent shivers down his spine and then proceeds to say goodbye to everybody, I don&#39;t actually think it was made because of that he may of not even known at the time of writing this song, regardless its a FUCKING masterpiece and if I could of met anyone it would ALWAYS be Freddie, rest in peace sir."
5369,"BTW, LOVE your reaction! Wouldn&#39;t be a real reaction if we told you what to expect. I&#39;m that Black female from South East Texas that didn&#39;t have very many Black radio stations except Wolfman Jack out of Mexico, so trust me I knew about QUEEN from day 1.  Have the birth certificate to prove it. LOL."
5370,"These niggas????? LOL. If you ain&#39;t melanin, don&#39;t use that word!!!!!!!"
5371,Your reaction was so much fun I had to watch again.
5372,"What&#39;s going on in that middle part is that Freddie is the guy who killed a man, the four heads are the judges, the multiple heads are the crowd in the courtroom, and everybody is speaking incomprehensible legalese, but no, they will not let him go."
5373,"Most everybody has heard this song at one time or another, but may not have realized it, either by turning it off at certain parts or tuning it out.  However, this song takes on a different meaning, when you listen to it in it&#39;s entirety, step back and take it all in; you realize that it&#39;s a masterpiece. A Rembrandt for a song. Many people breaking this song down feel Freddy Mercury was using the story line  as a metaphor for the tragedies in his own heartbroken life. In the end his sexuality for which he was judged for, really doesn&#39;t matter (&quot;nothing really matters&quot;) in the bigger scheme of things known as life and what goes beyond it. To conclude, from No Life Shaq  as he points to his left and right eyes; &quot; I am raging on this side, and crying on the other&quot; , which summed it up eloquently, he get&#39;s the depth and meaning of the  story being told with great musicianship."
5374,Freddy Mercury and Robert Plant the two best leads singers ever.
5375,"Watch. Queen live aid 1985 ..,,.one his best concerts"
5376,"Queen is their own class of music, nobody else really sounds lile them. Jethro Tull is also a band that defies standard convention in musical classification. Try Aqualung or Locomotive Breath, both very deep songs."
5377,RIP MR MERCURY
5378,"If I could bottle your enthusiasm and sell it on eBay, we would both be rich ✔😎"
5379,I can&#39;t stop watching these
5380,best Queen reaction video !!!

5388,They don&#39;t sound like angels they are angels
5389,Queen - I Want To Break Free !! Lets get him react to that squad!!
5390,If I remember this song was about when Freddy found out he had got AIDS so basically you could consider this as a song about how he feels on it.
5391,😂😂😂Just laugh my butt off at the AC DC Back in Black reaction. Had to come back and watch this and find it 10x funnier.😂😂😂
5392,Bad Brains!!!!!!!!
5393,IS THIS A CRISTMAS CAROL
5394,Might possibly be the best rock song ever
5395,You need to watch queen live aid
5396,Best reaction on youtube!!!!
5397,I loved your reaction!!! The best ive seen ...
5398,That&#39;s not &quot;rock&quot;  it&#39;s &quot;operatic rock&quot;       But for christs sake listen to a song without pausing it... let it hit you at once.
5399,pathetic..
5400,May all of our doors open to find the best in life... good stuff
5401,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m57s"">6:57</a> <br><br>Especially: <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m51s"">6:51</a> &quot;What the Fuck is going on?!&quot;"
5402,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m27s"">6:27</a> HIS FACE LMFAO"
5403,"If you want to listen to a brutal Queen song, try Death On Two Legs."
5404,"Freddie always loved the sound of Oprah,rock,and other types of song types. In all respect we really miss you Freddie murcury. Rip Freddie murcury we all loved you"
5405,"More Queen, they were a head of their time, always pushing boundaries."
5406,"You gotta do somebody to love live i just watched ,that shit blew me away!"
5407,"This type of music isn&#39;t familiar because it was meant to be revolutionary,it officially termed a &quot;rock opera&quot;and it includes opera,a ballad,metal,and classic rock."
5408,I think he was talking about the fact that he caught hiv but put it in his own words. Anyway to a God a icon rip Freddy Oh yeah the song is deep one of his best work and as well for the group.
5409,I love his reaction to the video! Hilarious
5410,Bro I first discovered you with killshot and I love your videos bro 😂😂. You gotta do break free by queen. You just got a new subscriber
5411,"Fat Bottomed Girls // Queen<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMnjF1O4eH0"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMnjF1O4eH0</a>"
5412,Freddie Mercury is a legend  please do more reactions to Queen
5413,The songs about Freddie mercury (the singer) and his sexuality which he kept hidden his entire life from the public the song goes from feeling guilt confessing to his family to confronting his inner demons (beezelbub has a devil put aside for me) and then to triumph of self acceptance (so you think you can spot in my eye)
5414,I strongly recommend doing a double reaction to both Metallica’s cover and Wuweb’s original of Stone Cold Crazy
5415,"I LISTENED, AND TURNED PEOPLE ON TO THIS WHEN I WAS IN 7TH GRADE"
5416,"IT&#39;S AN OPERA  DUMBSHIT.......<br>ALL YOU KNOW IS ONE GENRE. ...HOODSHIT<br>YEP, IT&#39;S A GENRE............"
5417,Queen&#39;s play on Opera.  You should look into more Rock Operas. The album Tommy by The Who (a british group) is one. Queensryche has an album that is considered a rock opera and they are metal.  I am enjoying your reactions to Metallica. I am glad to see you opening up to other genres.  All music is a gift.
5418,Freddy Mercury was so damn good it was unreal! You must let it play and let the emotions take over! It WILL happen!
5419,Ha ha ha!
5420,Dog........ It took them 70 damn hours to record this thing
5421,PINK FLOYD
5422,Pausing it every 5 secs and screaming into the mic. Good job.
5423,This song is pure genius in every way. You know this because every single magazine on earth and critic hated it originally. It took decades for it to catch-up to our ears and minds. That shows the absolute brilliance of Freddy Mercury
5424,Hey COACH! Want more rock-opera? Check out Meatloaf: Bat Out of Hell. THAT’S TOUGH!!
5425,This man said it sounds like a Christmas carol😂😂😂
5426,react to somebody to love by queen
5427,Queen - somebody to love live montreal 81 pls coach
5428,Man I love you so much. I want to just always know love and happiness.

5430,"If you liked this song, i&#39;d like to see your reaction to stairway to heaven by led zeppelin."
5431,Freddie Mercury
5432,Seen a few of these the past couple weeks - by far the most hilarious reaction......love it!
5433,Hahahahahahahhahaha
5434,He is a amazing singer rip Freddie
5435,"One of the best songs of all time sung by arguably the best frontman of  all time. Listen to whatever you want from Queen, Freddie Mercury&#39;s performance will be flawless.<br><br>But if you want something else to react to (that will put a tear in your eye):<br><br>Queen - Love of m life (live at Wembley)"
5436,The single greatest vocalist to ever have stepped foot on this planet.....<br><br>Freddy mercury
5437,Love your vids man!  I grew up on this my dad had the Greatest Hits album in his car on the way to school.  Check out their other songs they&#39;re so diverse you&#39;ll love em :)
5438,"First off, the sing is the one and only Freddy Mercury.  Second the song lyrics are not th3 original lyrics as its been discovered within the last few years.  Part of the song is him hurting his mother.  In life he was bi but went gay which hurt his family who were some successful pakistanis.  They sent him to a boarding school for men in hopes this would help but did the opposite.  So it hurt to see the fights between his dad and himself.  Later it talks about time to go and not born at all.  This was added as he discovered he had contracted aids from his previous lover.  The end continues this saga and respectfully had nothing to do with his new llver/ partner.  So in a nutshell, this song is about Freddys life, loves,  losses and death."
5439,"Yo, check out Motley Crue &quot;You&#39;re All I Need&quot;... React to this dawg &amp; tell us what you think! Is it a Love Song or a Hate Song? You&#39;ll be the judge... hehehehe...Holla at an islander Boii..."

5448,How about the song “this are the days of our lives” Queen. I really really like this song of queen
5449,Freddy mercury was gay. If you didn&#39;t already know this little piece of information it might bring some light into the content of this song.

5464,Best and famous song on them
5465,Someone should have had Freddie Mercury&#39;s baby. Was artificial insemination a thing then?

5470,"You have got to react to jinjer pisces man. Absolutely blow your mind. Yeah, it&#39;s me creeping on old vids."
5471,Freddie didn&#39;t kill anyone.  He was coming to terms with his sexuality.  He was talking about himself.  He wanted it to be three songs from operatic to rock.  Brilliant guy.  Best vocalist and charismatic frontman of all time.
5472,“I don’t know if I wanna throw my phone at my mama or call my mama and tell her I love her??” 😂😂😂😂 Bro your vids sure do lighten up my day. Thanks!

I suggest you watch their full Live Aid performance and then Somebody to Love in Montreal.  Those will give you a good idea of the extent of their talent and why the loss of Freddie hit us so very hard.  He is still mourned greatly.  LOVED your reaction.  You just gained another fan.  53yo rocker girl from CA  :-)"

5702,Give us some respect.. we were listening to this in the early 70s
5703,Your reaction was so genuine and great - wonder why you never have done any more Queen?  I was thinking you would really get into Somebody to Love -- or Don&#39;t Stop Me Now... a little disappointed it&#39;s been this long....
5704,Children in my age group are all focused on that mumble rap/ rapish hip hopish genre. But I’m glad people are branching out to music I grew up
5705,This was called a rock opera

5711,Go Bucks!
5712,It is said that this song is about Freddie Mercury coming &#39;out of the closet.&#39; Don&#39;t know if that is true. He was gay and died of AIDS in the 90s.
5713,"Queen is literally one of thee best bands/groups ever. And the lead singers name is Freddie Mercury. He was in love with cats btw. A very unknown fact. Also almost none of their songs suck They are all great to listen to. Very well done and beloved by all, at least by me. They are my #1 favorite band on the planet."
5714,you are funny as anything dude
5715,"Freddie was coming to terms with being gay.  The man he killed was his straight self.  Mama didn&#39;t wanna make you cry.  Lyrics, vocals, harmony, switch ups, just genius.  That&#39;s our man Freddie."

It was amazing, close your eyes and it was like listening to their records.  Have been a Queen fan for years and once bitten, you never see music any other way!!! There is no one that comes close to Freddie Mercury and it always warmed my heart to know that my older brother got me into Queen before they actually became really famous!!!  Long live QUEEN!"

5796,"Heard this as a kid, couldn&#39;t understand what the hell his point was. I liked the song cuz it sounded unique and I always appreciated good singing. At some point I realised he&#39;s saying he&#39;s coming out of the closet.. and he&#39;s not accepted."

Keep up your reactions :)"
5806,"This song was about how he killed someone by giving his sexual partner aids.......meaning the lead singer. The song was written by him and is his life parody. He, himself dies from aids."
5807,"I&#39;m glad you opened your horizons to other genres Shaq.  What do you actually think about rock and metal now that you have reacted to some of it?  Growing up I just listened to country music.  I didn&#39;t really like anything else.  Then in college I met all kinds of friends that were not just country hicks like I was.  lol.  They listened to rock,  rap,  metal.   everything.  so that&#39;s when I started listening to other kinds of music.  Rap and metal and grunge became my favorites then.  Now I listen to pretty much everything,  and I&#39;m glad I do because there&#39;s so many talented artists in all genres.  I&#39;d like to see you react to Pearl Jam,  maybe the song Black from MTV Unplugged.  It was really great.  His voice is amazing.  Really soul ful and even bluesy."
5808,&quot;goobye everybody I&#39;ve got to go&quot; - that&#39;s it!!

5810,"Bro the point of the song in the beginning is about a suicide note left by the guy singing the line &quot;put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead&quot;  - he&#39;s opplogizing to his mother and goes on &quot;life has just begun... thrown it all away... didn&#39;t mean to make you cry&quot; get it now!!

5862,Freddie Mercury is one of the best singers in rock history and will remain so for long in the future and his passing was one of great sadness.
5863,"Mj is better than Freddy, and I&#39;m a rock person"
5864,The opening was just a multi track of Freddie&#39;s voice and not the four of them as it appears.

I believe he was referring to having unprotected sex and spreading the virus.<br>I wanted to share that one thing with you and when you listen to the song after seeing the movie I am thinking you will get the depth of the words.<br>I have enjoyed watching a few of your reaction video’s,  just subscribed.<br>Happy New Year."

5913,Listen to Jethro Tull - Thick as a Brick (PLEASE AAAAA)
5914,"Yes Freddie is in fact, an angle..."
5915,"Freddie Mercury was a super vocalist. As far as music, to me, Queen was ahead of their time. I used to love hearing their songs come on at the local skating rink back in the day. I knew it was time to show out."
5916,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m23s"">6:23</a> &quot;phfpfhphfpfh&quot; lmao"

5921,"I&#39;m used to you reacting to hip hop (which is my first love) But i love classic rock too, glad u did this"
5922,Freddy Mercury.  He died of AIDS.  RIP
5923,"The singer is called Freddie Mercury, the best singer of all time.<br>That five octave vocal range is amazing."
5924,No one fucking pauses in a guitar solo.  Especially Queen!
5925,Princes of the universe by Queen.
5926,This is one of those songs you should listen to in complete silence to understand and feel every word and musical note to take you on the trip in the first person with them.
5927,I love it
5928,"IDK if our dude here is checking the comments, but I know how much you&#39;re into the lyrics of songs.  This song was Freddie Mercury&#39;s coming out as gay song, and every lyric is SOAKED in metaphor and meaning.  <br><br>I love your videos man, keep up this awesome work."
5929,Check out another one bites the dust
5930,"...&quot;from a happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick!&quot; LMAO! Dig your commentary, bro!"
5931,"I just wanna day I adore you, dude. You brighten my days."
5932,"My bro, I&#39;m glad to see you have learned that the Musical experience of Rock isn&#39;t all long hair, black Jean&#39;s and black shirts, but it is all about a journey of emotions"
5933,"You &quot;Queen has to many transitions&quot;<br>Maximum the Hormone &quot;Hold my sake&quot;<br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC-wDpwzEt4"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC-wDpwzEt4</a>"
5934,"Brotha, I&#39;m a white bread Irish boy from New Jersey. My two fav bands of all time are Led Zep and GNR......in that order, ..BUT my all time favorite song is Bohemian rhapsody by all means and I must say that u and I have a very similar interpretation of the song. Much props"
5935,"You should watch the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, all about Queen"
5936,This whole album was made like a rock opera
5937,LOVE this reaction!
5938,Congratulations on poping your Queen virginity. Now go listen to the rest of their songs and get your mind blown.
5939,Queen your bipolar. That is just too funny. Okay I&#39;m going to give you a couple more recommendations 1 gloomy Sunday.. and there&#39;s a song called Renegade. It starts with oh mama I&#39;m in fear for my life for the high price on my head.whisky lullaby. And a Country Boy Can Survive isn&#39;t a bad one either. There&#39;s just so many more.
5940,"Freddie Mercury not only had a phenomenal voice,  he was the consummate showman and live performer.  More pure vocal talent than MJ, all around musical talent on par with Prince,  and stage presence better than both. <br><br>Freddie Mercury is,  in my humble opinion,  the greatest frontman in the history of Rock n Roll."
5941,"Bro, that was the best reaction to this song. I just watched your face and I was rolling. You&#39;ll never hear anything like that again. Truly one of its kind. Queen was a unique band that could go from rock ballads, pop and operatic songs to speed metal. Freddie&#39;s vocal range allowed him to cover a whole swath of musical genres and the Brian May (guitar),  John Deacon (bass) and Roger Taylor (drums) were top musicians and song writers. I guarantee you know some of their songs because of just how much they&#39;re played. &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are The Champions&quot; are sports venue staples. And if you listen to &quot;Under Pressure&quot; you&#39;ll recognize the bass line that was stolen from Vanilla Ice (&quot;Ice, Ice, Baby). BTW, Queen sued Ice and won. <br><br>This is when I grew up in the late 60&#39;s through the 70&#39;s. Arguably the most explosive and creative time in music history. There were so many groups like Queen, not to mention The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd,  Lynyrd Skynyrd, AC/DC,  Grand Funk Railroad, The Eagles, Blue Oyster Cult, Judas Priest, David Bowie, Frank Zappa, Yes, Jethro Tull, Kansas, The Police, The Kinks,  and so many, many more rock bands started in this period. Metal, hard rock, pop rock, stoner rock, punk rock, alt rock, and on and on."
5942,"&quot;Queen, Y&#39;all are Bi-Polar!!&quot;&quot; best reaction line I have heard to this day. They had him up, down, and all around, it was funny to watch."
5943,Who is this singer.. what&#39;s his name ????
5944,This is like a trip!
5945,I&#39;ll say it one more time probably the best reaction video to Queen  ive ever scene
5946,Freddie Mercury
5947,I heard that this was a reaction to one of the singers teachers saying he could never sing opera......<br>so this is his rock opera to prove that guy wrong......
5948,So about the two doors in his background...1 is for the entrance and the other to exit?

5975,"Classic Queen. This is the quintessential song by the. This doesn’t sound like Christmas carol it’s more like choral. Musically and vocally this song is beyond the point of OUTSTANDING!!!<br><br>This is the band that let me know many Rock musicians (Europe mostly) have a classical background and they also have an affinity for Soul, Jazz etc.<br><br>It would be interesting what your take would wit AC/DC Back In Back since your expanding your range musically.<br><br>Check the lyrics to Phil Collins In The Air."
5976,&quot;These niggaz sound like angels&quot; needs to be a sticker on a Queen best of album.
5977,"&quot;Ya&#39;ll don&#39;t prepare me for this. I feel like a punk and a gangsta.&quot;<br><br> Oh brother, how much is that not life? Broken one moment, and king of the world the next."

6031,"That sir is voted the best if not the best the 2nd best rock song of all times, check out the other song regarded as the best, Led Zepplin&#39;s Stairway to heaven and decide yourself"

6042,is anyone else freaked out THAT HE HAS NEVER HEARD BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY..... or Wayne&#39;s World for that matter <br>SERIOUSLY ????   WHAT.......THE........FUCK            hehe
6043,"The beauty of &#39;Rock&#39; music is the fact that it doesn&#39;t fit into any &#39;type&#39;. Rock music can go from War Pigs to Bohemian Rapshody. Most rock music has a message, be it political or spiritual. It&#39;s one of the reason mainstream politicians do not like rock music, it draws attention to their flaws."
6044,"You had heard this before. As you are aware, posting a reaction to Bohemian Rhapsody was a very popular trend in October, and for a short while was a guaranteed way to get a few thousand more views than usual."
6045,A black person who hasn&#39;t heard queen?? I&#39;m shocked!
6046,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=1m26s"">1:26</a> your reactions are hilarious."
6047,"Man, when you watch/listen to these big hits...it tears you up...and I laugh my ass off...you are the funniest reactionist..."
6048,Greatest front man of all time. He actually wrote this song about being gay
6049,SSSooo brutal and SSSo SSSouftly
6050,Freddie was the greatest frontman  of all time in my opinion. I consider myself lucky to have seen Queen back in the early eighties. Freddie&#39;s voice was a gift from God.
6051,You should listen to I want to break free by queen
6052,"Man, I found your reactions yesterday! Brilliant, and excellent work in expanding your horizons! Once you’ve gone through your “rock and metal” journey have a look into some British 2-tone - madness and the specials are probably the two better known and see where that leads you! Keep it up!"
6053,"He looks and sounds like the family member that&#39;s at the family bbq licking his fingers and saying, &quot;Come here boy. Let me tell you something.&quot;"
6054,Freddie Mercury is hands down the best front man in the history of rock.  Check out his performance at Live Aid &#39;85. It&#39;s considered the greatest 20 minutes of live music. Freddie controlled that entire crowd. It was an extraordinary kind of power.
6055,WTF is going on? LMAO  ....one word....QUEEN
6056,Your reaction was very hilarious I agree or emotional rollercoaster but I got to agree it&#39;s one of one of their best songs for being so chaotic different feelings everywhere
6057,Please react to Tinnman- &quot;Walk through the Fire&quot;.
6058,"Check this out my dude, the lead singer Freddie Mercury, has a degree in art &amp; graphic design, the guitarist Brian May...excuse me, Dr. Brian May is an astrophysicist. The drummer, Roger Taylor a degree in biology and the bass player John Deacon a degree in electronics. <br>And their incredibly talented to boot. Also Brian May recently took part in a project for NASA."
6059,Holy Shit you are funny. This was the most Fuckin&#39; hilarious reaction i have seen so far.
6060,Did he say melondy.  You mean melody? Lol
6061,Freddie Mercury is probably the best performer that has ever lived. Simply awesome!
6062,Rip freddy
6063,Party  on Wayne
6064,So glad you opened your music horizons to find this! And yes... He did indeed say the meanest thing ever in the most beautiful way.
6065,A bucks hat!!!?? Fuck yea bro!
6066,Daaamn you reviewed queen.. this is the best rock bad of all times man  .. RESPECT
6067,"I lived in Earls COurt, in London, for over a decade.  The business that I ran would, on a daily basis, have kids 18 to 20, coming in, to ask where Freddie&#39;s house was.  This was 20 years after he died.  He lived just around the corner."
6068,The great Freddie Mercury died of AIDS on Nov 1991 just two weeks after Magic Johnson announced his NBA retirement because of HIV. I remembered those two events 27 years ago as if it had just happened today.
6069,Another One Bites the Dust and Under Pressure.  Both of those will blow your mind.
6070,That&#39;s freddie mercury  dude....just keep on

6084,The singer is Freddie Mercury. The GOAT
6085,The beginning had me laughing. You&#39;er not the first reactor I&#39;ve seen commenting that it sounds like a christmas carol in the beginning xD
6086,"You want to be blown away?! Try: Baby Metal, Megitsune.  Awesome song and video. Praise be the fox god and the metal god."
6087,"<a href=""https://youtu.be/G3LvhdFEOqs"">https://youtu.be/G3LvhdFEOqs</a><br><br>Bro just listen and you will thank me now. <br><br>Mr Crowley by ozzy. This song is insane <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RipRandy"">#RipRandy</a>"
6088,"What i love about these videos isn&#39;t neccessarily the choice, the song the band (all of which are fantastic), but you genuinely listen to the individual lyrics. You break the songs down and force me to listen to songs I have known for years by what they are actually saying. Thanks for that. Great reaction keep on going mate"
6089,"I was gonna like this video, then he paused it at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a>.... and something inside of my died a little!"
6090,I think this is the first time i heard queen called niggas but hey do you
6091,The Legendary Freddy Mercury.....R.I.P.... If you&#39;ve seen Wayne&#39;s World this song in it
6092,"Freddie Mercury is the lead vocalist. Re listen to the song with these facts in mind: <br>Freddie was a gay man in the 70’s, this song was wrote right after he contracted the HIV virus. The person he is speaking of is himself."
6093,U crack me up my g awesome song tho
6094,Larry lurex
6095,Listen to Freddie alias Larry lurex
6096,"Fun Queen fact, the lead guitarist is also an astro-physicist."
6097,you have an extremely annoying voice and accent man
6098,Ha ha Hilarious reaction.  Excellent.  And that was Freddie Mercury.  RIP Freddie.
6099,Damn... still waiting for more Queen reactions....

6103,Bruh you were in gus jhosnson channel. And he telling that your reaction about bohemian rhapsody is fake.

6109,No auto tune as well love these guys tip Freddie mercury
6110,Best song ever
6111,Please react to The Doors (The end) (Spanish Caravan) (LA woman)

6113,I wanna see Him react Marilyn Manson
6114,Try Queens song Under Pressure...
6115,Freddie Mercury was really a gifted individual.
6116,That my friend is Freddie Fucking Mercury.....
6117,"I love watching you discover Rock and Metal, and I love that you are looking to step out of your comfort zone for it.   What makes reaction videos work, is that they make you feel like you are sharing this amazing music you&#39;ve discovered with friends.  There are some great performers.  Give Iron Maiden Run to the Hills, or The Trooper a listen to.  Ozzy has too many songs to list, but since you liked Black Sabbath you got to move on to Ozzie&#39;s solo work.    And if you like Metallica,  you&#39;ll probably like Megadeth as well, try Symphony of &quot;Destruction.&quot;  Rush does amazing things with just three guys.   You&#39;d think they have a ton, and their drummer is easily in the running for the best drummer of all time.   Steve Vai does things on a guitar that don&#39;t seem possible, and Stevie Ray Vaughn is possibly even better.  Meat Loaf, yes that really is the artist&#39;s name,  has a flair for lyrics that will blow your mind.   Just  when you think you know where he&#39;s going, he&#39;s going the opposite direction.  Pink Floyd get&#39;s classified as rock but it&#39;s really it&#39;s own genre, and Dark Side of the Moon, has been on the billboard charts longer than any other album ever made.   But while your looking to expand your horizons, give old country music a listen.  Johnny Cash is one of a kind &quot;The Man in Black&quot; isn&#39;t his best song but it will give the best feel for him as an artist.  &quot;Hurt&quot; is a cover but it&#39;s one of his best  So is &quot;I walk the Line&quot;.   Willie Nelson, can tell a story and make you feel it better than anyone alive.  Try &quot;Seven Spanish Angels&quot;, or &quot;The Ballad of Pancho and Lefty&quot;.  Tim McGraw &quot;Please don&#39;t take the Girl&quot;  and &quot;Live like you were dying&quot;  are life changing songs."
6118,&quot;It sound like a Christmas Carol!&quot; 😭😂
6119,Check out fat bottom girls by Queen
6120,This Song is a timeless masterpiece of music history
6121,"This is what happens when you open your mind. I’m did this like 2 year ago and discovered metal. I was always into classic rock like this, but never listened to Sabbath, AC/DC, Deep Purple, Maiden, Metallica etc. Best rock music ever when I did. Queens up there"
6122,"Love his reaction when it kicks in. Dude, did you not see Wayne’s World? Famous scene"
6123,Haha love this
6124,I’m rolln at your reaction 😂😂 love it tho!! You crazy
6125,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m11s"">6:11</a> when the beat drops !!! LMAOOO"
6126,Its called ”a rock opera” and with this one song freddy mercury created more or less a whole new genre.
6127,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=9m01s"">9:01</a> &quot;I don&#39;t know if I wanna throw my phone at my momma or call my momma and say I love you!&quot; LOFL"
6128,"someone needs to share this video across all media platforms, easily best reaction to Rhapsody out there. haha"
6129,"Omfg. Shut upppppp. Stop talking. Listen to the song. Listen to the LYRICS. Most people think it&#39;s saying he gave someone AIDS. IT ISN&#39;T. It&#39;s about him coming out as gay and leaving his old self behind. I have listened to so many reviews of this, of people hearing it for the first time. You don&#39;t analyze the actual meaning. Listen again and figure it out and give a review."
6130,Freddie Mercury was Indian!! People don&#39;t realize that...probably the most whitewashed artist ever.
6131,“He just said the toughest thing in the world but with the voice of angel” yes!!
6132,"You should listen to Freddie&#39;s isolated vocals for this song. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHYjIIJ14MI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHYjIIJ14MI</a>"
6133,Your reaction is priceless.  Thank you!

6135,Ahhh hell...... you sure you are ready to jam with the GODS?<br><br><br><br>Ok....saw the video..... you were NOT prepared for them. Awesome reaction.  LMMFAO
6136,"R.I.P Freddie, gone but never forgotten"
6137,"This is bullshit! Youve definitely heard this song before, and you know it!! EVERYONE has heard this song. I dont give 2 cents about cultural bullshit, This song literally transcends cultural lines! This is just a ploy to get views! Youre a liar! People in other countries who dont even speak English know the lyrics to this song. I dont even listen to rock, and even my 8yr old knows this song! Its literally been played over the radio, in movies, and even in elevators and grocery stores for DECADES! You are a fraud, and this a pathetic attempt at getting views! You should be ashamed of yourself!"
6138,Yep Freddie Mercury.
6139,Slipknot NO LIFE

6151,GO BUCKSSSS
6152,React to three days grace
6153,The reason why the song does not sound like rock is because the song involves opera or the operatic section but the rock part comes in after the operatic section.
6154,Rhapsody means episode after episode lol
6155,It&#39;s called rhapsody lol fun huh

Though it had many inconsistencies it still touched me in so many ways emotionally. it will do the same for you too."
6163,"About him singing about killing a man, he&#39;s not literally singing about killing someone. He&#39;s singing about  coming to terms with his real self and figuratively killing his old, fake self."
6164,Freddie Mercury . The world&#39;s greatest frontman .
6165,"So you know how big of a thing Queen is, but you name the video „first time reaction“? Shut up... you cleary know the goddamn song... you little faker..."
6166,Love your reaction to Queen so had to share it on facebook 😂 😆
6167,Freddie Mercury is the greatest singer of all time!
6168,This is an era when autotune did not exist. It&#39;s also an era when REAL rock had meaning...
6169,Freddie was a singing God!
6170,You should do a reaction to Five Finger Death Punch song Jekyll and Hyde
6171,When queen blows your mind then does it 7 more times
6172,Freddie Mercury could cover FOUR octaves from low F sharp to alto F sharp FOUR OCTAVES. This was the first event in the WORLD to be seen LIVE by more than ONE BILLION PEOPLE. ONE BILLION.
6173,You think queen is bi polar try listening to Byob  by system of a down
6174,And this song was written by just ONE man. Freddie Mercury! That so-called genius that some people refer to as Kanye West absolutely trashed this song.
6175,lmfao you sooo funny

6180,You gotta listen to his last song these are the days of our life. He sang that with pure passion as he was dying. It truly is a masterpiece.
6181,"The reason I like these videos is because, as a metal head, it brings me back to earth. It lets me see again, what I love about rock and metal so much. The sound alternating was domething they did to make the song THAT MUCH more interesting. And him Shaq pointing that out made me realize this. Thanks bro."
6182,😂😂😂😂😂😂
6183,Listen to jasper loco “product of the block” real Chicano rap
6184,It&#39;s awesome seeing such genuine reactions.  Keep doing what your doing! 😊

6186,I understand coach.. this song hits me in my feels too.
6187,you are soooo much fun to watch!!!!!!!!!!!! thank you!
6188,"There are many documentaries on YouTube about Freddie, queen, and Bohemian Rhapsody as a song. I recommend checking them out. Freddie was a genius and one of the best male vocalist of all time. Keep up the good work brother"
6189,This guy is acting like he&#39;s never heard music before
6190,Gus Johnson says you&#39;re full of shit. He might be right.

6199,"Hi There,  i would like you to listen to 2 songs from Queen earlier years. the first song being a favourite of mine YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY. and the second being MY FAIRY KING. please give us all your views to these two songs. thanks"
6200,The song has 5 parts which makes it unique
6201,The greatest singer in rock history
6202,He&#39;s telling a story... LISTEN!
6203,Hahahahaha! Your reaction is rich!!!
6204,"This is still my favorite reaction to listening to Queen&#39;s Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time. With the approaching Christmas season upon us, may I recommend you doing a video of listening to Tran-Siberian Orchestra&#39;s Christmas Eve/Sarjevo?"
6205,I grew up listening to this on the radio. Love your reaction!
6206,"Here&#39;s where it got a new life: Wayne&#39;s World:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyJOnasHVE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyJOnasHVE</a>"
6207,"You’ve heard of the rap god, but not the rock god ‘Freddie Mercury’ ❤️"
6208,The momma/phone comment ..... ROFL
6209,"Well, he just killed a man and now has to face death..."
6210,"Ahaha! I&#39;m balling I&#39;m laughing so hard!!!!!!!!!!!!! &quot;He just said the meanest thing in the world, but sound like an angel...&quot;"
6211,"Shaq - gotta say that based on this reaction (my favorite of all TIME), you&#39;d be open to a little more music by Queen  - but hey, that&#39;s just me..."
6212,RIP Freddie Mercury
6213,This is the best reaction I’ve ever seen lol 😂 u solid my dude
6214,3 songs in one
6215,"lmao *long silence*.............&quot;what the fuck is going on&quot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m45s"">6:45</a>"
6216,"No Life Shaq, I love your reaction to this video. I never knew who Queen was before the movie and I had heard bits of this song in movies but never actually learned about it. Because of the movie I did a bunch of research and I almost wish I never learned about them because I&#39;m so hurt we lost someone as amazing as Freddie &lt;3"
6217,"Gotta give it to you, man. I have heard this song SO SO SO many times. Liked it back in 91 when I was in high school, when it was a funny scene in Wayne&#39;s World, got totally sick of it to the point where I never ever listened to it in full probably in the last 20 years. And you made me re-listen and re-appreciate it. In fact, I heard some shit I never really noticed before. The song is a true masterpiece. Thanks bro!"
6218,"Its been a month and no other queen reaction , would love to hear you do more queen reaction  coz queen are goats on fire and your reactions are fire, should listen to some off their  live performances their simply  amazing"
6219,"You&#39;re full of shit, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never heard this song before. This whole reaction video thing is getting out of hand. Just stop."
6220,Queen have great music... the legend... no autotunes... no computers... real voice...
6221,stop stopping!!!<br>Doing my head in
6222,What is with these fake ass videos of people claiming to never have heard mother fucking Bohemian Rhapsody before???
6223,"What you really need to do is STOP  pausing the damn song and stop talking over the song!!!! All you reactors do this and it pisses all of us off!!! STOP IT. Don&#39;t you sing, let Freddie sing. You ruin it for those who want to hear the song from start to finish, then do your comments!! I cannot watch any more of these reaction but you by far are the worst. I now only listen to some guy named Jason. He stopped pausing it and got alot better. You are horrible!!!"
6224,Sandwich short of a picnic springs to mind
6225,LMAO....you crack me up Bro...that&#39;s Tuff
6226,Hahaha!! Such a raw reaction. Well worded. &quot;I don&#39;t know wether to throw my phone at my Mom or call her and tell her I love her.&quot; Lol!!
6227,OmG!! I laughed my head off watching you..too funny. Legendary Freddie Mercury RIP
6228,Yeah Freddie was the best known male voice alive
6229,If you skip queen you should be in jail right now
6230,Its god Freddie mercury
6231,"A video you should check out is The Jokerr-I Gave it All. It has that effect of goin from speaker to speaker too. Its a badass hip hop song from a dude who wrote, produced, and rapped his own tracks and the video is shot by him. Just check it out, you wont regret it"
6232,You put in to words what I feal and didn&#39;t know that the music was doin that. Yes it gives you highs and lows and you are only along for the ride. I love you man . You are awesome .
6233,I Love You Man keep doin it
6234,I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more stupid.this guy pretending that he never heard Bohemian Rhapsody or the people in the comments believing him
6235,The reason he wished he was never born at all. Is because he was an Tanzanian man living in Britain! And not only that. He was homosexual. It would of been very very hard for the poor guy 😥😕
6236,This was the funniest reaction to this song I’ve ever seen- loved it!
6237,"Classic song, clasic reaction. Mind blown!  Great vid"
6238,"This song is in another league and so was Freddy Mercury.<br>You have to watch Queen on Live Aid, their performance was mind blowing."
6239,Freddy murcury
6240,"In a weird way, I envy you. I wish there was a way to experience music and humor the first time again, and these reaction videos from various people are the closest thing to that. <br><br>&quot;That sounds like christmas carol! They sound like angels!&quot; Made my day"
6241,Led Zeppelin-Over The Hills And Far Away
6242,That was fucking funny. I&#39;m crying here.
6243,This is by far my favorite video of yours! Watching your brain melt through all of the different transitions and different styles of music brought joy to my day! Know that what you&#39;ve just watched is one of a kind.
6244,OMG 😂 the opera section reaction had me dying so hard I hard to rewind and rewatch the reaction cringe it was soooo funny
6245,Queen - the show must go on <br>It&#39;s in your lane my dude
6246,This is comedy!!!! 😂😂😂😂
6247,Freddie Mercury the sad thing in that he&#39;s dead he died 1967 through 1991 he died of AIDS
6248,&quot;Am I tripping or these niggas sound like angels?&quot; 😭😭😂😂😂😂
6249,Dude - we&#39;re all waiting for more Queen !
6250,"<b>Still wiping tears from laughing so hard</b>  Your expressions and comments are priceless!  My two favorites: &quot;You just said the harshest thing possible and said it like an angel&quot; and &quot;Ya&#39;ll are bi-polar, Queen.&quot;  I&#39;m a retired therapist and, tbh, it is very possible Freddie Mercy lived with some type of depression, ADHD, etc.  In interviews he was very quiet and shy.  Have you watched any of the Live Aid footage of Queen?  TOTALLY different look and even in the softer moments of this song his later renditions were sung more powerfully.<br><br>Thank you for the video!  I&#39;m looking forward to going to the movie next week - 24th anniversary of his death, sadly."
6251,This is the greatest Queen reaction........EVER. fucking.................EVER. <br>love this dude.<br>&quot;i dont know whether to throw my phone at my momma or call my momma and tell her i lover her&quot;<br>&quot;i feel like a punk....and a gangsta&quot;<br>greatest quotes ever <br>Shaq.....you are the Queen of reaction videos my dude.
6252,the answer to your question is how many have said in your comments....the one and only...the motherfucking legend...the greatest male singer and front man....Freddie Mercury.
6253,Absolutely the best queen reaction I ever seen hands down I couldn&#39;t stop laughing 😂😂😂😂😂 I love Queen and this is my favorite song by them
6254,He’s not joking about the sound going from ear to ear. I had a car stereo with only one side of speakers that worked. When this song came on the radio I could only hear my driver side speaker and half of the opera part. But it was ok because I was singing so loud I didn’t miss a beat.
6255,You are wrong very wrong about that you are not a punk you are not a gangster you&#39;re a good man and a good father I know you love your children and I know you&#39;re a sweet man just because you hear rock and roll does not make you less man you&#39;re a human being and you have every right to listen to whatever you want God bless you brother
6256,Queens real name is not Freddie Mercury his real name is farrokh basara he&#39;s not British he&#39;s Pakistan he died of HIV AIDS
6257,considered one of the greatest songs ever made
6258,The lead sunger is Fredie mercury
6259,ohh cmon man.... my kids was born 2005 they know this song..... where the hell have you been..???
6260,Do somebody to live by queen
6261,Bohemian Rhapsody is like the song from the future.
6262,Thunderbolt and Lightning ... a shootout between the singer and a gang that wants revenge for the killing<br>Do a bit of research for the song :)
6263,Dud your reactions are the best please god do SOUND OF SILENCE BY DISTURBED
6264,"excuse me Shaq, but you played this song while MGK is still behind those doors? just asking bro..peace."
6265,"c&#39;mon  Somebody to Love, please!  your reaction to this is so great, that I&#39;ve looked at it probably 15 times and sent others to look as well......"
6266,My friend you have been my favorite first time hearing Queen expression
6267,"Freddy Mercury, the greatest voice in rock music"
6268,Welcome to the world of GREAT rock music. A new door has just opened up for you.
6269,Only the best rock band if all time including the legendary Freddie Mercury and the only ones who knew how to make good music🙄

6283,Jumpin jack flash or gimme shelter by the rolling stones
6284,That’s basically a rock opera
6285,"My guy, if no one else has reccomended it yet you need to check out Stairway to Heaven by Led Zepplin.  Old school rock, but the best song ever written.  One critic called it &quot;the best 8mins of your life with your clothes on.&quot;"
6286,By far the funniest reaction to this song. Welcome to Queen. 🤣
6287,"I honestly think almost everyone of us was like this:they listened to Bohemiam Rhapsody for the first time and they thought it was kinda weird.And then they listened a few more times and thought &quot;my music god,this is a masterpiece&quot;.That is talent people.Freddie is playing with our souls and minds.Freddie is.....just....Freddie."
6288,Stunned silence to the operatic sequence sums it up.
6289,Hands down your best reaction ... had me lmao
6290,I love u Shaq but how the hell you don’t know who Freddie Mercury is !!!

6299,Names freddy mercury died from aids

6301,“How could you say something so brutal so nicely” LMAO
6302,"love the look on your face at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m50s"">7:50</a><br>Freddie Mercury had one of the best if not THE best voice of all time.<br><br>Bro you gotta do a video on ACDC, would love to see your reaction to Angus Young playing guitar in his school boy outfit that he always wears"
6303,I see you&#39;ve discovered some real shit Shaq.. You won&#39;t regret listening to more Queen. Trust me on this one.

6305,"You look like Dez Bryant, cuhs this Dez, on my momma it gotta be! 😂😂🤣"
6306,rest in peace freddie mercury
6307,the legend freddie mercury
6308,I now see why a music video reaction turned to be around ten minutes.
6309,"I would like to make 2 special suggestions almost no one will give you:<br>2 bands:<br>The Warning: start with &quot;survive&quot; at TedX, and then &quot;21st century blood&quot; official video. They have a new song called &quot;dust to dust&quot; which is incredible.<br><br>Motion Device: &quot;thick skin&quot; and then &quot;doves and snakes&#39;.<br><br>There&#39;s a reason almost no one knows them, but they still are amazing! You&#39;ll see it by yourself.<br><br>React to them and I will explain you why so good musicians are so unknown...<br><br>Thanks a lot and enjoy!<br><br>P.S.<br>I will post this comment on a lot of your reactions because you may not see it most of the time because there are plenty of comments."
6310,"Freddy Mercury is his name..and he has one of the most iconic voices in rock history. While Queen is technically rock/pop and not metal, a lot of their lyricism and musical ingenuity led the way and influenced some of the greatest metal bands in history.  Freddy was one of the first mega-star rockers to come out as openly gay, and this song was his struggle after contracting AIDS. He died in 1991 at age 45 from complications of HIV."
6311,Yo! This is the greatest reaction ever! you made my day. Thanks! I subbed.
6312,"When you asked, who is this singer, I wanted to burst into tears."
6313,Switching up flows like Sicko Mode way before Sicko Mode
6314,You should see the movie Queen
6315,The man who sing dead of AIDS 1991

6324,Anyone here after watching the Bohemian rhapsody movie?

6326,Still miss him ❤❤
6327,Genius FREDDY MERCURY 🌹❤

6331,Best Bohemian Rhapsody reaction I’ve ever seen😂😂😂
6332,"Have you heard &quot;Somebody to love&quot; by QUEEN? I would love to see you react to &quot;Barcelona&quot;  by Freddie Mercury feat. Montserrat Caballe!!!!! Freddie is (in my opinion) 1 of the most brilliant  &amp; talented people that we were blessed to get a piece of shared into our lives, our kids lives &amp; many, many more generations. R.I.P LOVE!!!!!"
6333,Gus Johnson&#39;s video? Anyone?
6334,I cannot believe how gullible and irresponsible these comments are. None of you all have noticed that all of the sudden everybody&#39;s reviewing Bohemian Rhapsody? And faking these elaborate reactions just to get views... Shame on y&#39;all and everybody making these fake ass videos capitalizing on the greatness that was Freddie Mercury. Pathetic.
6335,like that bucks cup tho
6336,please watch and react to Marcelito Pomoy singing The Prayer..please
6337,CLASSIC
6338,"You really don&#39;t know how to listen to music, do you?  Why stop the song every 10 seconds? Man!"
6339,"Orangutan trapero, no puedes oir CALLADO una cancion y analizarla??"
6340,do pink floyd bro
6341,Freddie Mercury one of the best ever
6342,Check out ac/dc long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll. I think youll dig the bagpipes
6343,this is the best composed song in the history of music......give me another song if you differ
6344,"I&#39;m sorry, but I REFUSE to believe that you and the hundreds of other reaction channels are seriously hearing this song or even Queen in general for the actual FIRST time."
6345,Does one of your doors go to heaven and one go to hell?
6346,"One of the first fame HIV victims, but a genius Songwriter. RIP Freddie, the Real Queen of Hearts!"
6347,React to Queen at Live Aid 1985.
6348,"The new film Bohemian Rhapsody is a film about this band , I recommend watching it , it’s a brilliant film ! 🙂"
6349,"If you like this you need to listen to Fat Bottom Girls by Queen, especially if you like a girl with a big ass."
6350,Your reaction to this song is the BEST ever!
6351,LOVE your reaction! You have been indoctrinated!
6352,300% triggered
6353,You gotta do Live Aid Queen performance :)
6354,This is the reaction I want when I try to show my friends badass songs like this. But they just ignore the song then go &quot;thats cool&quot;
6355,you just listened the best song in history brother..<br>now you can die in peace..<br>listen more songs of queen..
6356,Freddie Mercury
6357,&quot;They sound like angels&quot;.. True that!
6358,"&quot;I don&#39;t know if I wanna throw my phone at my mamma or call her and say I love you&quot;<br><br>Yeah, Bo Rhap will do that to you."
6359,You’re too much
6360,You should watch them at live aid 1985
6361,Queen :<br>We are the champion&#39;s
6362,"Freddie Mercury could start a riot by reading a phonebook, or threaten to murder you and you&#39;d thank him for it. His voice was *POWERFUL*. And he could bend it in knots. He could hit notes only dogs could hear, or roar so powerfully a lion would back down.<br><br>And yeah, Queen&#39;s music was <b>very</b> emotional. If you like this, I recommend Queen&#39;s &quot;I Want To Break Free&quot;.<br><br>Queen was known for switching things up. Timing on their drums, sound inputs and outputs, style and tone changes. They could take you 0-60 in a heartbeat, then chill you out on a nice slow cruise. You never knew what to expect when listening to them for the first time."
6363,Amazing reaction! Have you seen the “Bohemian Rhapsody” movie yet? I highly recommend it. Incredible!
6364,"Ok shaq pretty much what hes saying is he killed a guy now hes facing death penalty he wishes hed never been born at all , cause then he wouldnt have fucked up and put his mom through the shit he caused and send a bolt of lightning is electric chair"
6365,Man this is the best reaction so far!!
6366,Radio gaga live aid.. watch that
6367,nice reaction n very honest
6368,I love ur reaction ❤
6369,These gahs sound like angels yeh they do
6370,Bohemian rhapsody is all about the main singer freddy and him being gay so when he said he killed a man hes talking about himself or the image of him as a straight man because it was a time where if u were gay u would have been shunted  and more or less likely to be killed thats wa it is all about and the fact that he died from aids before Easy-E did
6371,This man don&#39;t know Freddie Mercury 😮
6372,"Btw. Brian may, the guitarist, is an Dr. as well. In astrophysics. Yeah. Hes a genius and a master musician."
6373,I laughed so hard I pissed myself....oh God that was priceless!
6374,Coach is passionate bout his music 🎶!
6375,Bro you got me dead af😂😂😂
6376,"YOU REAL!! Man... I never comment, but you’re the real thing bro! It makes me smile to see dudes open up to music and feel it. Because of you, I’m gonna open my mind (and I’m an old ass 45 year old that still listens to cassettes!)."
6377,"Dont know why so many got shocked with what they called &quot; transition&quot; of a piece of music, its a norm for classical music which has different movements on certain mood, system of a down is similar too and Queen! Gee i wish i can witness their LIVE concert! Freddie Mercury &amp; band, u will live forever"
6378,Singer is legend Freddie Mercury
6379,So wish he hadn’t died so young.....he wrote the song too! Freddie Mercury.
6380,"his name is freddie mercury, he was a legend!!!"
6381,Try listening to who wants to live forever by queen greatest vocals ever Freddy at his best
6382,Bro i saw your metallica ones and im so happy your opening your tatses. I highly recommend reacting to iron maiden. I&#39;d say start off with fear of the dark and hallowed be thy name. I think you&#39;d really like those
6383,Love your reaction so funny. Xx
6384,❤❤❤❤❤
6385,<b>Priceless reaction</b> 👌🏼
6386,"You really ought to read up on Freddie Mercury. He&#39;s a gattdamm legend. Intensely private and mysterious; one of the absolute greatest singers ever and this song doesn&#39;t even begin to cover his incredible range of talent. But not just him. The entire band could easily have been lead vocals of any band from that era and been hugely successful. They all have/ had SO. MUCH. TALENT. <br><br>Being someone who talks about music but doesn&#39;t know the history of even mainstream music like Queen is, dare I say, laughable. <br><br>You wouldn&#39;t have a lot of these rap and hip hop songs without Queen. Rappers Delight? Queen. Ice ice baby?  Queen. I&#39;m positive there&#39;s more. <br><br>What I&#39;m trying to say is you need to get to know this particular band. They&#39;re important."
6387,Freddie fucking mercury hands down one of the best if not the best rock n roll front men to ever grace the stage! <br><br>Absolute fucking beast on the mic
6388,"For those that want to see Queen at their ferocious best, you need to watch them perform &quot;Now I&#39;m Here&quot; at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1975.  It is literally explosive:<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvOuRt_BiRI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvOuRt_BiRI</a>"
6389,do I want to break free by Queen
6390,So glad I found this channel. Got me in stitches my guy
6391,The artist&#39;s name is Freddie Mercury
6392,“The transitions in this song is outrageous” 😂... this reaction doesn’t have enough likes 👍🏾!!
6393,You just listened to the pinnacle of what my genre has to offer. And were proud of it.

6420,This song is in some way believed to be Freddie&#39;s coming out song and shows the conflict of his emotions talking about how his old self died and how he has to move on
6421,&quot;No f*cking way!&quot;<br><br>Yes f*cking way.  Welcome to the greatness of Queen :)

6426,his face when the operatic bit kicks in Lol. WHAT THE HELL??!!! HAHAHAHA
6427,"Queen are the greatest band of all time, hands down. Music that touches the soul."
6428,the song is about him having AIDS and how he&#39;s gonna die
6429,"And if you like the left to right he headphones action, you need to hear Led Zepplin! Whole Lotta Love.<br>Does it for almost the entire song. lol"
6430,"This song is about getting AIDS. Then he slept with another man and gave him AIDS, maybe. Thus the line, &quot;Just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he&#39;s dead&quot;.   He came and gave him his disease. And when I die, carry on. And he didn&#39;t want to die, but the pain makes him wish he was never been born at all. He talks about dying from the disease, how much pain he&#39;s in, shivers down his spine, body&#39;s aching all the time. From AIDS."
6431,"Bipolar?  Tripolar, I think."
6432,"good call bro. if youre reading this, call yer mum..."

6435,"This has to be the Bohemian Rhapsody of youtube reaction videos. People need to start making reaction videos to this reaction video, It&#39;s that much of a classic!"
6436,Throw my phone at my mama or call my mama and tell her i love her AHAHA ahahahahaa
6437,This is so weird! I am looking at an Andre Iguodala-looking dude who sounds like Kevin Garnett reacting hysterically to a legendary Rock Opera Masterpiece!
6438,The legend freddie fuckin mercury!! Rest in peace
6439,"You are to funny man. You have me dying over here. Keep up the reactions. I grew up on all this music, was born in 73. Try some Alice In Chains, or Pearl Jam (even flow). Start getting into some Alternative after Metal, then you will get even more followers."
6440,Shaq you should do a video on &quot;Pigmeat Markham - Here Comes The Judge&quot; some argue that this is one of the first rap songs and it was released in 1968
6441,Awesome to see when people expand their musical interest I&#39;m A hip-hop head myself but without classics from Queen and many other rock bands You wouldn&#39;t have some of the best sampled beats in hip-hop
6442,Did you actually say that  Queen sounds like a Christmas carol
6443,I love ur reactions bro hahaha
6444,He killed a man and is facing execution for his crimes.
6445,"That there is the musical Genius of Freddie Mercury. It is a rock opera. If you listen to more of Queen you will see they or not ab and you can fit in a box marked rock or pop or something like that they did just about everything in their career. If you listen to some of their other music like Killer Queen, under pressure, I Want to Break Free, Fat Bottom Girls, I want it all, The Show Must Go On, bicycle, who wants to live forever, Somebody to Love, Another One Bites the Dust, all the music they did for Highlander the movie and TV show coma you will see the musical genius of Freddie Mercury and queen. Everybody says Freddie Mercury is the band and he is the front man he is a musical genius however half of the music was written by Brian and John and they all participated in the writing and collaborating of their music. We Are the Champions We Will Rock You was written by John one of their biggest hits under pressure was actually a duet with David Bowie but yet most people only listen to the live version with Queen alone. Don&#39;t get me wrong Freddie Mercury was the absolute best front man ever he was a musical genius there will never be anyone as talented and as open with his music as Freddy was. When Queen first started Brian was the singer Freddy just played piano and sang backup vocals on the first two records it wasn&#39;t until the third record that he came out into the spotlight and the band realized what a phenomenal Entertainer and musical genius that Freddie Mercury was. He even did Opera. If you look up Barcelona you will see a live performance of him singing opera with a wonderful female opera star. there wasn&#39;t any thing in music he could not do. You want to know the Real Genius of Queen and Freddie Mercury go back and listen to some of their songs even some of the songs that weren&#39;t great big hits you&#39;ll be blown away. he died way too soon. I often wonder what music he would have made if he had lived while longer. and I&#39;m just thankful that he worked so hard when he was sick to leave us his last works. I just can&#39;t understand how anybody has not heard this song even in this day in age it hit number one twice it&#39;s been in countless movies when you turn the dial on something because it&#39;s not your genre you miss out on some of the most awesome music ever made"
6446,👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 now that’s a great reaction to a wonderful song 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👑
6447,There&#39;s a hilarious video of Tech N9ne singing this all drunk back in the day. Peep it so funny and bad ass.
6448,Subbed after watching one video - Queen reaction to BR. Cheers.
6449,"You say it doesn&#39;t sound like rock, but rock singers are very very good musicians. Good at Ballard&#39;s. Maybe react to Rammstein, stirb nict vor mir. It&#39;s dark and beautiful"
6450,Now listen to The Muppet version. 😂😂
6451,"If you want to see the best use of this song in a movie, watch &quot;Wayne&#39;s World&quot;  the first one, not the second one (though they are both good)."
6452,"yo my man, u should check out led zeppelin - stairway to heaven out. Its also a masterpiece that sounds quite similair to this. And if u wanna try some more opera like metal, nightwish - phantom of the opera. May the metal gods bless your soul forever"
6453,look up freddie mercury
6454,React to Queen- we will rock you ( live )<br>The video is of Freddy Mercury in a yellow jacket. That is one of the best of all time
6455,Lmao@happy christmas morning.. Dawgg u the man- hella love your reactions- yuze a foo!
6456,"SO awesome to see your reaction, hehehe  &lt;3"
6457,If you really hear the song he made this song because he had aids listen to it carefully and you’ll know why.
6458,"Best reaction ever, I&#39;m Ded 😂😂😂"
6459,"I would love to see you react to this Chinese dude named Dimash.  Here&#39;s a link:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEz1qGS0T1Q"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEz1qGS0T1Q</a><br>This guy has a range like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  OMG!  He will leave you speechless!!!  For real!"
6460,This is how reactions should be like...you kept it 100...but never stopped listen...words need to be heard..if not fully understood.. great reaction
6461,some of my favorite quips: <br><br>“he just said the meanest thing in the world but he sounds like an angel saying it” <br><br>“he can sing his ass off though”<br><br>“*exhales forcefully*”<br><br>“these boys came from a happy christmas morning to halloween real quick”<br><br>“how y’all expect me to turn down that quick”<br><br>“i don’t know if i want to throw my phone at my momma or call my momma and say i love you or something” <br><br>“*yells at empty room* LOOK”<br><br>please do more of these 😂
6462,"Okay I know these reactions are all the rage at the moment but this is the BEST. I laughed so hard all the way through it. Your reaction is awesome. You should also check out Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Radio Gaga, Under Pressure (Live at Wembley) and of course We Will Rock You!"
6463,You should really do a reaction for their song fat bottomed girls.
6464,Best reaction.  Welcome to brilliance.
6465,BITCH THATS FREDDIE FUCKING MERCURY
6466,"&quot;Momma&quot; is referring to his then girlfriend, nicknamed Momma, about their break up I think."
6467,Dude you sound like my grandpa times 3
6468,3m 15... that moment when the gangsta realises..  he is the mark.. and the song is the O.G.... mind blown..
6469,I hate that about react
6470,The song is about him coming out of the closet and the man he killed was the him that he could no longer be
6471,Freddy Mercury
6472,It&#39;s symbolism don&#39;t take the words literally he took the gun to his head because he&#39;s getting rid of his old life it has a different meaning <br>it&#39;s deep<br>❤
6473,They sound like Angels ❤
6474,You need to listen to Queen &quot;Don&#39;t Stop Me Now&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;.
6475,Love your reaction
6476,My all time favorite band. Freddie Mercury is a god!
6477,"Bohemian Rhapsody and even something like Styx&#39;s Renegade had many of the same themes of despair, non-conformity, relationship to one&#39;s mother, conflict with the law you would later hear in Tupac&#39;s music or N.W.A.&#39;s. No wonder Rap reactors both get and are confused by this song. It does things musically they&#39;re not used to, but some of the imagery, semi-abstract as it is, is familiar."
6478,You&#39;ve got a new fan man !!!!<br>Bipolar must be the best description bro...hahaha<br>You really make me laugh my ass of man !!!<br>Keep this coming bro .....!!!!!
6479,I&#39;m from the Philippines &amp; Bohemian Rhapsody movie is currently showing here. The sleeping Queen fan in me was awakened that&#39;s why I checked some reaction video of Bohemian Rhapsody and your video was the funniest &amp; I enjoyed it very much. I&#39;m 49yrs old by the way... Can you do a reaction vid on Don&#39;t Stop Me Now by Queen pllllleeeaaasseeee..............
6480,Try we will rock you by queen
6481,How about shut up and listen instead of talking so loud and pausing the video
6482,The best reaction to Bohemain Rhapsody i ever seen. You were genuinely impressed. Love your reactions my guy!
6483,"Me at the beginning of this song: There is no way you haven&#39;t heard this song, why are you lying to me?<br>Me at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=2m35s"">2:35</a> : Call Uncle Rukus  and tell him I need his noose, this Ngga guilty.<br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=10m11s"">10:11</a> : Okay I see this man can be spared from the inquisition since he isn&#39;t a heretic anymore."
6484,How Bohemian Rhapsody Was Made (spoiler alert 🚨) (if haven&#39;t seen the movie pls watch it for more understanding) <br><br>Freddie Mercury want to make a song with a genre of rock and opera and so the Song Called Bohemian Rhapsody. They Want it to be played in a radio but there&#39;s a guy who disagree because the song was 6 min. Long and the radio wouldn&#39;t Play that to long and it will never be popular<br><br>But then one radio whatever it called.. Freddie pushed the radio man to play the song... So then there it didn&#39;t really make it popular but it hit in top 5 in London and UK so then they more music until Freddie Mercury dies in AIDS/HIV the rest of the members   released a single album in memory of Freddie Mercury.. After the release Of Bohemian Rhapsody it hit top 2 in America and now the legend song still in our generation.... <br><br><br>Sorry about my english or grammar I&#39;m Filipino)
6485,You should try Motorhead &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; for a quick trip!
6486,They Are Not Just Angels They Are Legends
6487,loooooool! That&#39;s some legit reaction right there.
6488,Ur throat needs lotion
6489,Good reaction bro!  But why you in yo own house in your PJ&#39;s busting a sag?
6490,"This song was “Sicko Mode” before there was “Sicko Mode” from the transition of the song! Haha! But for real though.... this song was actually Freddy Mercury’s (the lead singer) coming out song. When he said he just killed a man, he was referring to his “straight” self. And then he goes on telling his mom about carrying on without the straight son she knew. And the rest of the lyrics is pretty explanatory now that you know the meaning behind the song. Nevertheless, it’s a GREAT song!"
6491,Double dog dare you to listen to Chris Stapleton “I was wrong.”  Don’t be fooled by the country label.  He also covers James Brown’s song “It’s a man’s world” pretty damn well.
6492,"I liked seeing this wit some1 who never has, that was fun."
6493,Are you from Milwaukee?
6494,"the best part of this reaction is from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=0m00s"">0:00</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=10m43s"">10:43</a> “that’s tuff”"
6495,please more
6496,You turned Queen off??!! Mannnnnn... “that’s tuff”
6497,Come on men... Hahahaha thats crazy.
6498,You&#39;re the man - you let it happen and it will do you good! There&#39;s an award for you 🥇
6499,Best quote ever: &quot; I don&#39;t know if I wanna throw my phone at my Momma or call her and tell her I love her!&quot;
6500,He is one of the most iconic singers from our generation! Queen are massive ! (I’m 46) 😂🙈 I was brought up listening to this ! And when this song was made it was 6 mins long ! In those days that was unheard of go and watch him doing live aid ! He kills it you will never ever get another Freddie Mercury ! 🙌🙌🙌🙌
6501,Freddie Mercury the one and only rock legend
6502,"The singer is Freddie Mercury (a name that he changed legally) and was born on an island in 1946, moved to England and started the band “Queen” and performed all the way until he died of complications with AIDS in 1991. His fellow band mates are still alive and helped film the movie “Bohemian Rhapsody” which is in theaters and shows the story of Freddie and Queen"
6503,ROCK OPERA...!!! Freddy is KING...!!!
6504,"I must&#39;ve seen a dozen Bohemian Rhapsody reactions, I think I might be addicted, I love vicariously reliving hearing it for the first time, chills every time."
6505,MIND BLOWN!!!!! 😶😶😶 WWWHHHOOOAAA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 BTW when you tried harmonies with Freddie you made my dog howl!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 😶😶😶😶😶Bless Your ❤️ Best Reaction Ever!!!

6509,Freddie Mercury
6510,I love u man this is awesome I love this song too btw
6511,The man <br>The myth<br>The legend <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>God bless our souls<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Freddie mercury <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The godess
6512,I&#39;ve read somewhere on the web that this song is Freddie&#39;s comin out of the closet song. A subliminal message.
6513,Please listen to We are the Champions&#39; it&#39;s my favorite of their song&#39;s
6514,"Shaq&#39;s mind blown at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m22s"">6:22</a>"
6515,"I find it impossible to believe people have never heard of Queen, more so bohemian rhapsody. If you don’t know these kinds of songs kids you don’t know real music period. Which would explain why you’re all so happy to listen to shit, you’ve never heard real music before."
6516,Is there subtitles
6517,"I really got annoyed all your chatter! Just listen to the music, then make your comment. You keep interrupting, which made me give you a thumbs down."
6518,The lead singer is freddie murcury
6519,How&#39;s he never reacted to Mr Brightside
6520,"&quot;these niggas sound like angels&quot;, probably the last thing Queen expected to hear about their music."
6521,"React to Queen&#39;s &quot;Under Pressure&quot;   another great song.   It&#39;s the song that they sued Vanilla Ice for stealing as the music for his one &quot;hit&quot; ice ice baby.  You&#39;ll recognize the beat immediately.  Please check it out.  and btw put V.I. on in Ja Rule pile.    lol     <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23That"">#That</a>&#39;sTough"
6522,"ok now do we will rock you/we are the champions, TWO songs in one that are actually connected as one"
6523,You gotta look into Freddie Mercury.  His Bio is great.  A great artist and musical genius who lived a very tortured and lonely life.  He was trained in opera and very much a perfectionist in all music projects.
6524,Can you do a reaction to AC/DC &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;
6525,React to cannibal corpse hammer smashed face
6526,"Lmao<br>&quot;I dunno if I wanna throw my phone at my mama or call my mama and tell her that I love her&quot;<br>&quot;Queen, ya&#39;ll are bipolar&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;m raging on this side and crying on this side&quot;<br>&quot;I feel like a punk and a gangsta&quot; 😂"
6527,"😂😂😂🤘 I cant stop laughing omg<br>Funniest reaction to this song, ever"
6528,"and you used to turn it... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=2m32s"">2:32</a><br> i&#39;m glad you opened your horizon!"
6529,freddie friggin mercury
6530,Sounds like your baby is crying to death whilst you watch videos and ignore your responsibility.
6531,"Dude, you gotta check out the rest of Queen&#39;s stuff. You&#39;re in for a treat."
6532,Great reaction and a great turn of phrase plus I like the fact that he needs to be warned before listening to a piece of music.....
6533,"No offense, but what&#39;s with black people getting into rock now...."
6534,He had aids
6535,When you said mama I killed a man I interpret that he was saying he killed himself because he contracted the HIV virus AIDS virus put a gun to his head pulled the trigger now he&#39;s dead without having protective sex he got infected now the other part is how could you love me and leave me to die I interpret that as the people he was with that he was having sexual relationships with love him now he&#39;s infecting he&#39;s dying so they&#39;re leaving him to die based on but they did one of the most brilliant songs ever written but the true meaning who really knows
6536,Lolol Queen yall are bipolar. ..lol
6537,I wish i could listen to bohemian rhapsody for the first time again
6538,Lay off the fucking drugs dick head
6539,Please react to killer queen!!!

6577,This song is about a man on death row for murder.

6579,"i am watching this and feeling so lucky. I grew up with so much great music. 8 years old and i already had.... LL Radio, doug e fresh,  melle mell and the soundtrack from beat street, beastie boys and other rap artists. I also owned sooo many other genres...rock, disco, pop, and blues. I&#39;m also feeling a little sad for my man shaq because i can&#39;t imagine missing out on a lifetime&#39;s worth of incredible music. Maybe it&#39;s different because i&#39;m a drummer and i&#39;ve always had music in me in a different way than most, but i&#39;m glad you are now experiencing so much more that all types of music have to offer."

I grew up on music like Queen, so I can only imagine what it´s like to discover them later in life, but man it must be amazing! If you want some cool live ones to check out (that I haven´t seen anyone else react to), try Bruce Springsteen - Kitty´s Back, live from Hammersmith Odeon in 1975, Dire Straits - Private Investigations (from Alchemy), Stray Cats - Stray Cat Strut, live from Montreux in 1981 or Santana - Soul Sacrifice, live from Woodstock in 1969. Under any circumstance I´ll keep watching your videos, cuz your reactions are downright priceless!"

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFDYuO53BUk)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFDYuO53BUk)</a>, and if this song was ok, you should listen to Styx, Come Sail Away (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm-Vh3j8sys)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm-Vh3j8sys)</a>"
6627,"That&#39;s queen for you, do whatever the hell they want with the music, put as many musical influences in there, Innuendo is still their best song in my opinion"

6631,"ну у тебя и эмоции, чувак) прикольно было наблюдать)))"
6632,Great reaction!!!
6633,"Knowing the song for ever I was so exciting to see your reactions in any part of this song...and now,  Hip Hop guys thought they were creative and crazy musically ?  ..and all this was made with great musicians playing drums, bass, guitar, piano and vocals...... no electronic loops, samples, sequencers, synthesizers or pre-made sounds...."
6634,It&#39;s insane to think how this song was built. It&#39;s not like now with digital recordings. This was recorded with layering the vocal tracks that means your vocals had to be seamlessly perfect when you did your vocals and had to exactly match exactly. Keep in mind at that time they were recording on tape. How have you never heard of Queen? They are nothing but hits :)
6635,Freddie Mercury. Legend.
6636,"You need to try to listen to some &quot;TOOL&quot; music.  The song &quot;46 &amp; 2&quot; would describe you advancing your horizons.  For those of us that have the mental condition Synesthesia, the band TOOL puts on quite a good show in the head."
6637,"Now you&#39;ve reviewed this, please watch the Green Day crowd sing this at their London concert.   It will blow your mind."
6638,You need to do 45-shinedown

6645,Goddamn this is the best Queen reaction ive seen so far.
6646,"Creepy how relevant the second verse is to his death even though he wrote this long before he contracted aids....<br><br>“Too late<br>My time has come. <br>Send shivers down my spine <br>Body’s aching all the time. <br>Goodbye, everybody <br>I’ve got to go<br>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth”<br>:c"

6661,The greatest song featuring the greatest reaction😂😂😂😂

6677,"For context, a lot of what he is singing about is his struggle with being gay and how it conflicted with pop culture at the time. Freddie was a notoriously &quot;complex&quot; person and a lot of his personal struggles were transposed to his (and the band&#39;s) lyrics."
6678,"Really enjoyed watching you react to this classic of a song. If you wanna check out some more classic rock, listen to Kansas - carry on wayward son, dust in the wind, and trail of tears. These guys are classically trained, professional musicians doing rock music."
6679,I&#39;ve been into Queen ..10yrs old in my 50s now ..old school.
6680,Welcome to Rock n roll..😂😎🎤🎶🎶🎶🎶💯💯💯💯

6686,"man I laughed so hard with your reaction bro, it was genuine. Thank u. And im glad u got the chance to experience this art piece."
6687,"The part where there are all the different versions of the singers,that&#39;s them singing in different octaves."
6688,I was LMAO at your reactions! Loved it
6689,this dude is how u say trippen lol
6690,Welcome to the paradise! To the best rock band in the world and the greatest voice icon and majesty Freddie Mercury
6691,"That, my friend, is Freddie Mercury. The man with the voice of an angel who got taken from us way too soon. <br>He is one of the best damn singers there has EVER been. He was also a fantastic songwriter, he wrote this song himself."

6718,N the song we will rock u n we are the champion were theirs...  Yes..  The anthem...
6719,this song is Freddie Murcury coming out as gay.  he&#39;s talking about killing his old &quot;straight&quot; self and coming out ro his parents

6742,Try &#39;Another One Bites the Dust&#39; by Queen!
6743,Best reaction I&#39;ve seen yet
6744,"Back in Dallas in the mid 1980s a band called Sheer Threat had a great gimick with this song. They used to sneak back on the darked stage just after their break while this song was playing on the club sound track. No one noticed. Then just as the song ripped into heavy guitar crescendo, the stage lights suddenly flashed on and it was Sheer Threat playing the rest of the song!! It always really  freaked the audience out! Great trick!"
6745,"I search for Queen reactions which is how I found you, instant sub. Please react to more Queen, you will not regret it."
6746,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=3m11s"">3:11</a> [insert Taco Bell meme here]"

6756,"Absolutely Loved your reactions &amp; commentary, &amp; you made me laugh my ass off too LOL Much respect for journey down rock &amp; roll&#39;s highway!!! Freddie Mercury was one of the best vocalists of all time!!!"
6757,Plus there were no autotune or harmonising software  in the 70&#39;s..  We didn&#39;t even have computers.. lol
6758,perfect time to check this out as there is a movie releasing soon of the same name as this song about them.
6759,"I love the emotion you put into your reactions, it makes it feel very genuine. My only complaint is this. Do you have to be so loud with everything you say? It just feels like you yell every word. I appreciate the enthusiasm but maybe turn your headphone volume down a little so you don&#39;t have to yell everything just to hear yourself speak."
6760,one voice for the choir.
6761,Freddie Mercury is KING... Queen was nothing without him
6762,This was made in 1975. It would top  the charts today today too
6763,Check out some Pink Floyd
6764,You really missed out man!

6766,Iconic
6767,&quot;Bro what the fuck is goin on?&quot;
6768,I heard Freddie Mercury was originally from Morocco which is in Africa.
6769,"Your comment of “raging in one eye, and crying in the other” is hands down the best description of this song I have ever heard...This song is all about the feelings Freddie felt after being told he had AIDS, which he contracted by sleeping with a man. I encourage you to listen to this again with that knowledge, and everything from the lyrics to the sudden transitions makes sense. This song is meant to be felt, not heard."
6770,Freddy fuckin Mercury
6771,Holy shit. This is the best Bohemian Rhapsody reaction by far. 🤣🤣🤣
6772,Candidate for one of my favorite reactions on YouTube ever.

6791,"I cannot imagine the reaction if you listen to March of the Black Queen. Or for pure Freddie, live version of Somebody to Love. Either would be interesting to see. And probably hilarious."
6792,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m09s"">6:09</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> the funniest reaction ive ever seen to a queen song in my life 😂😂😂😂"

6809,"Queen was talking about how much of a roller coaster ride that you have when you have a murder case. It goes from the crime, to the jail time, to the trial, to the jail execution. And they did this song in the 1970s. The lead singer is named Freddy Mercury. And he has been dead since 1992. Thier movie is coming out this Friday. Ya, I have been a deep fan of this group for the past 32 years."
6810,Dude you&#39;re the man...that bucks hat is sick too
6811,"I think I’ve seen ever reaction video of this song, and this is, by far, the best! I’m still laughing. Great job!"
6812,Once you listen to a few more songs from this legend check out “the show must go on” it’s one of the few songs he didn’t right himself that was written by a friend of his when they heard he has AIDS. This man was a legend who died way to soon.
6813,"BRO.... I just came upon you while watching metallica Videos... I gotta say man.., I&#39;m a fan... I play guitar and have since I was about 10.

6820,"How in the helkl can you possibly enjoy a piece of music such as this, which tells a story and needs that momentum when it changes."
6821,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m47s"">6:47</a> he was like what in the actual fuck is this song"
6822,Freddy Mercury was way ahead of his time. This was his “Rock opera” which makes sense the way it takes you through so many emotions and leaves you scratching your head but wanting more!! 💕
6823,"Dude, this reaction made me realize how much I’ve been taking for granted all these years, I’m reliving how I felt when I first listened to “Bohemian Rhapsody” all the way though. Great song, great reaction!"
6824,"Freddie Mercury thats who he is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=4m35s"">4:35</a>"
6825,Your Hillarious ! You have a great personality.
6826,Freddie wrote this entire song himself instrumental and vocal
6827,reactions very funny. good video great song
6828,Great reaction!!!    I notice black guys react to Bohemian Rhapsody similarly to black guys in those David Blaine street magic videos.
6829,This man needs to see Queen perform Under Pressure live at Wembley.
6830,Don’t know why but at times this dude sounds like Micheal rooker 😂
6831,I need to see you react to Stevie Ray Vaughn!
6832,"Freddie Mercury, he’s amazing"
6833,"&quot;Queen, yall are bipolar&quot;!!!  :-D Bless you bro, you made me laugh so hard with that!"
6834,6.52 what the fuck is going on ..Brilliant
6835,I fucking love this song bro
6836,May Freddie Mercury’s soul rest in peace
6837,Best reaction Ever! Freddy was the king of rock composition.
6838,"I remember playing this song with our schools Bigband, Orchester and Choir all at once. It was awesome. Had a lot of fun on that stage, although there were a LOT of people on the rather small stage. And we rented a HUGE gong just for that last beat. But it was so worth it. xD<br>Good times."
6839,"Haha, one of the best reaction videos I have ever seen.  Subscribing now.  I will have to watch this a second time.  Lauren Hill also does a beautiful cover of Bohemian Rhapsody.  Tie Your Mother Down is Queen&#39;s best straight up rock song.  It would be nice to see someone do a reaction video to that one.  OK, here are the songs that you need to listen to by Queen if you are truly a fan.  Maybe not particularly do reaction videos to, just give them a listen.  I am not using caps cuz it&#39;s too much work.  Stone cold crazy, bring back that Leroy brown, &#39;39, long away, teo torriatte, get down make love, sleeping on the sidewalk, bicycle race, if you can&#39;t beat them, fun it, don&#39;t stop me now, more of that jazz,  another one bites the dust, fat bottom girls, let me entertain you, headlong, I can&#39;t live without you, dragon attack, need your lovin&#39; tonight, crazy little thing called love, sail away sweet sister, save me, body language, put out the fire, calling all girls, under pressure, tear it up, man on the prowl, machines, hammer to fall, one vision, party, I want it all, the night comes down, modern times rock and roll, some day one day, loser in the end, now I&#39;m here, misfire, death on two legs, I&#39;m in love with my car, seaside rendezvous, good company, all dead all dead, fight from the inside, who needs you, in only seven days, leaving home ain&#39;t easy, play the game, it&#39;s late, rock it, coming soon,  the hitman, and just for the fun of it check out the Flash Gordon movie soundtrack, especially Flash&#39;s Theme and The Hero.  Sorry so long but all these songs are so good.  And the best thing is that not one of them sound anything like any of the other ones."
6840,React to jim Morrison and the doors
6841,This song is obviously about him getting HIV and apologizing. His “gun” is his dick and he killed a man because he didn’t know he had it. It’s not “gangsta”.
6842,This song went way over his head!
6843,Please listen to Muse
6844,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m52s"">6:52</a> is when i lost it hahahaa"

6853,"One of the greatest vocalists to ever have lived. The legend, the immortal Freddie Mercury. The saying goes, you live as long as you&#39;re remembered. Mercury will live forever through the music he and Queen made."
6854,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtLvlaGJJEU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtLvlaGJJEU</a>"
6855,he is hiv positive here
6856,It&#39;s not a normal song in the strickest sense. It was different even back when it was created. Good reaction. Perhaps you might want to try some Pink Floyd or Led Zepplin or Rush music in the future. I&#39;m going to watch your reaction again.
6857,did you just call then negros?
6858,"Seen the movie three days ago!<br>The US is in for a treat.<br>This is one for the cinema, iMax especially."

6863,You really need to check out Tool they will blow your mind
6864,You HAVE to react to Chris Stapleton sometimes I cry!!  It will rip your heart apart!
6865,Freddie Mercury! A GOAT!
6866,It&#39;s not one of their rock songs
6867,Yo coach if you wanna hear some good vocals check out Last in Line by Dio or Heaven and Hell by Black Sabbath(same singer Ronny James Dio) those songs are bad ass!!
6868,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=7m25s"">7:25</a><br>&quot;...came from a Happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick...&quot; <br>LMAO"
6869,"OK this is what i read into the lyrics,, the first part is his descent he did something that he is ashamed of and depressed about and how he didnt want to hurt anyone, and it would have been bet for him to have never lived..  the second part is he is in hell.. because of what he did and what he feels and he feels punished and the devil wont let him go.. the 3rd part is his triumphant  acceptance of himself his redemption.. at least thats what i read into it and that speaks to whats happened in my life.. many people over analyse it but queen and Freddies songs lets you put YOU into them. and they are powerful"
6870,Please check out Queen Somebody To Love live in Montreal 1981 because there singer            Freddie Mercury really shows his vocal range on top of a great song.
6871,"listening to Bohemian Rhapsody is like one hell of a possessed ride, i swear.. i love it"

6874,"I just found your site, I loved your reaction to this song...it&#39;s gorgeous! Can&#39;t believe some people have never listened to Queen. They were the best!"
6875,"&quot;What the fuck is going on!?&quot;. The reaction of many a man who hears this for the first time. Welcome to the world of Queen brother, in respect to your open mindedness I&#39;ve started listening to hip hop. Some bloody good music I never knew about!"
6876,Freddy Mercury baby!! He died in 91 of aids. He kept it quiet til he died. RIP

6878,But he died
6879,Brilliant reaction! Enough said!
6880,His names Freddie Mercury
6881,Best reaction ever!
6882,Freddie Mercury is one the greatest artists to ever walk this planet! Bohemian Rhapsody was about his coming out to his mother about being gay and it going terribly wrong. You really gotta break down each and every bit of this songs lyrics to understand exactly what’s going on the song
6883,"Freddie Mercury, the singer, actually wrote almost all of their songs himself. Definitely better musically talented than most out there today."
6884,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m51s"">6:51</a>  thanks for making my day  -- GooDLucK!!!"
6885,most rock music does different things in each speaker its called panning

This is the greatest PoP rock band of all time / the song was not about Freddy Mercury Killing a man It was about his battle with his own Sexuality , and the OLD him dieing and the New Freddy coming out of the closet  as gay .

6944,"This is one of more amusing reaction channels, i can already tell :&#39;D"
6945,Who is the singer? Lmfao
6946,"Interesting facts.... Freddie Mercury was one of the tragic casualties of the AIDS epidemic, the guitarist Brian May holds a few PhDs.... he&#39;s an Astrophysicist and the guitars he plays including the one in the video he builds himself to suit his pitch and accuracy, Queen has had many front men since Mercury&#39;s death including Paul Rodgers from Bad Company.... another band you definitely need to check out along with Lynyrd Skynyrd, and many guest singers!!!!"
6947,Fat Bottomed Girls
6948,"One of the interpretations is it was his coming out as gay without saying it openly. Otherwise lots of UK Rock-Pop has showtune influences, even the Beatles or others."

6956,Freddy Mercury. They got the movie coming out look it up
6957,"You guys can argue all day long but to me Freddie is the greatest vocalist of all time. Period. <br>What a performer, man. I watched their Live Aid performance and I been dead since then."
6958,"Mama, just killed a man<br>Put a gun against his head<br>Pulled my trigger,now he’s dead<br><br>“How can you say something so brutal so nicely and so softly”<br><br>Same"

Enjoy.  <br>If you do I Want To Break Free, understand that the video is a pisstake!"

6985,"It was only 1 person, FREDDIE MERCURY singing all of the harmonies.   That IS what we called Rock Opera back in the 70&#39;s!  You get a ballad, opera, rock and it ends in back at ballad.  He kills a man, confesses, the opera is the trial and if he&#39;s going to heaven or hell (Has a DEVIL put a sack on me?), then he resigns to his fate.  See the movie BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY Nov 2 to learn more about the group."
6986,You&#39;re acting as if you have never listened to this song before? What a sheltered life you must live
6987,"Yo Shaq, I&#39;m loving that you are expanding your horizons dude. You had me crying with laughter. Bohemian Rhasody is one crazy ride man and you should definitely listen to more Queen. :)"
6988,"Haha I nearly choked on my food watching this. Your reaction is hilarious! I love Queen. They actually made a movie called Bohemian Rhapsody, basically depicting their rise to fame."
6989,"When Axl Rose(Vocals,Guns n Roses)was asked,&#39;Who&#39;s your favourite Singer?&#39;, he answered,&#39;Freddie Mercury is my favourite singer and I&#39;m the next to him(meaning,No.1 Freddie Mercury No.2 Himself).The way he rated was so cool,doped and &#39;thats tough&#39;.😁😁😁"

7074,"Basically the song was about Freddy Mercury coming to grips with his bisexuality, mostly the homosexual part of his personality, the fear of committing a mortal sin with another man &quot;put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now he&#39;s dead&quot; you can figure out. Then it goes into how his mother and family will disown him, then you move into the operatic part with all the big voices, that&#39;s society judging him , then you pull into that big rock part that&#39;s him saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to what others think and the end is him accepting himself &quot;any way the wind blows&quot; ."
7075,🔥🔥🔥 React to Blackbird by Alter Bridge!!! 🔥🔥🔥 &amp; React to Down with the Sickness by Disturbed!!!🔥🔥🔥

7085,Do kansas wayward son
7086,"Please do Korn freak on a leash, you will really like Korn . There like metal meats hip hop, they even did a song with ice cube !!!!"

7088,one of the best singers ever. that intro was actually ONLY one person. freddy mercury did all four of those voices. he was an amazing talent and gone way too soon
7089,One of the best rock groups EVER.. 1 my favorite songs.. All hail Freddy Mercury
7090,"So a little background at the time bohemian culture was largely based in what we now see as the psychadelic hippie counter culture.  Rhapsody in music is typically a piece that doesnt have a fixed or contrived structure.  They often also transition different styles, this song starts as a ballad and changes its form multiple times. The mood also shifts sad, building anticipation,  climactic peak, and subtle epilogue kind of like a good story."
7091,Freddy mercury
7092,that&#39;s song was him.. it&#39;s revealing HER TRUE IDENTITY.. she&#39;s A QUEEN 👑.
7093,It&#39;s impressive how a person can change so much by just being more open minded. 10/10 would unsubscribe to subscribe again :v

7105,"Bless yo heart, bro.  You gave just been dipped in Rock Opera for the first time!!!  Somebody sure should have told you BE PREPARED but seriously there is no way to prepare a rapper for Queen.  You just have to dive in.  I have laughed so damned hard.  You are a Stone Cold Treasure!!  I love you!!  Welcome to QUEEN!  Now go find the Album called A Night At The Opera by Queen.  Bolt yourself to your chair, get something strong to drink or smoke and just live it!!  You will not be sorry."

7107,"Freddie Mercury is an Immortal bruh.  Queen is the only band on earth that can make a crowd at another concert Sing and head bang to their music. nearly 30 years after Freddie died.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnBNuqqz5g"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnBNuqqz5g</a>"
7108,This was recorded in HiFi! You&#39;ll hear part in one ear and part in the other.
7109,Nice choice of hat
7110,The lead singer is no else but the late great Freddy Mercury.. Queen is hands down the best Rock band to ever do it.. every single one of thier songs is a classic.. im a REAL HIP HOP fan but can get down with queen with no questions asked. Especially the WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS song.. I play that song every time my hockey team won the championship
7111,The movie about them is coming out in the theater in November 2 !
7112,Another good song from a British band is Painkiller by Judas Priest 😎
7113,Hahaha your reactions are the best!! They say this song is about the lead singer Freddie Mercury coming out to his super catholic family as gay. Don’t know how true it is but if you re listen to the song with that in mind it kinda makes sense.
7114,Do a reaction video to AC/DC Thunderstruck
7115,react to queen live aid

7120,Not all UK my man Freddie RIP.
7121,"These reactions are so fuckin funny and now imagine me seeing them live in 1986 in Budapest (Hungary). If i recall correctly Bohemian Phapsody are actually 2 songs Freddie wrote prior to joining Queen and since he didnt knew how to finish either of them he just put it together and here you go. If this was a mindfuck go and listen to Innuendo by Queen, thats some brain shitstorm."
7122,No life Shaq.... lol &quot;I don&#39;t know if I wanna throw my phone at my momma or call her and tell her I love her&quot; ha ha ha 🤣😂🤣
7123,"My favorite reaction yet, Shaq.  I love that you&#39;re branching out.  <br><br>Since you&#39;re expanding your horizons, you should react to Fiona Apple&#39;s video for Not About Love.  Zach Galafinakis is in the video.  I&#39;d love to see your face during that song. Hahahaha<br><br>Thanks for all great vids.  You&#39;re so entertaining and fun to watch.

7126,You should do a reaction to Johnny cash ♡
7127,Have you not heard of bohemian rhapsody??? It’s crazy that a lot of people haven’t heard this masterpiece. No offense to you but it’s been such a big influence in the music genre as a whole that it’s amazing that people still haven’t heard this?
7128,You should do the version of pentatonix (bohemian rhapsody cover) it&#39;s very interesting
7129,"Dude, you make so much fucking noise, why are you even pretending to listen to the damn song?"

7145,"Hahahaha. Quick turns, yeah? I&#39;m thinking GMF on the Wheels of Steel cos you&#39;re into hip hop. But Freddy changes genre, too, with Bohemian Rhapsody. Song still blows my mind 40 years after I heard it."

7154,RIP Freddy Mercury  ❤
7155,"This was funny as fuck :-) From someone who doesn&#39;t know what a &quot;rapsody&quot; in music is, to say that Queen was bi-polar was quite insightful. As a non-musician I would describe a rapsody as a musical rollercoaster, but this is a definition I agree with.<br>&quot;A rhapsody in music is a one-movement work that is episodic yet integrated, free-flowing in structure, featuring a range of highly contrasted moods, colour and tonality.&quot;"
7156,To truly get to the heart of Queen you have to watch them Live.  God they are so amazing live
7157,LISTEN TO NF THIS GUY  IS GOOD
7158,Yo. You should do a reaction to dubstep. Try listening to impending doom by sweettooth and lev3l

7160,"Queen at Live Aid in 1985 is the best live rock performance in history. It’s a crime not to experience that. Gotta react to it my dude. Loved this. Cracked me up. You have the best voice too, lol."
7161,Freddie mercury is the greatest singer of all time
7162,I think Freddie Mercury was speaking metaphorically about himself when singing this song. He didn&#39;t exactly kill a man but he did kill himself with his lifestyle eventually. Excellent song by the way. I&#39;ve listened to this song for years. Nice to see younger people excited about this song. 😀
7163,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m52s"">6:52</a> LMAO"
7164,You should definitely check out the band&#39;s documentary. You&#39;ll find it here in YouTube. Amazing story
7165,Thanks for expanding your musical background
7166,"I&#39;ve watched a number of reactions to this song but yours left me crying . . . so many memorable, hilarious comments.  Nice to be there as your life is changing."

7168,Gotta do stairway to heaven next
7169,And once again let the beautiful education of Queen begin.  Enjoy the ride!  Great great fun reaction!
7170,He didn&#39;t mean literally killed a man.  He was going through a transition in life and saying goodbye to the past.
7171,can you rewind a few seconds back after pausing?
7172,I would recommend either stairway to pinball wizard by the Who or Stairway to heaven by Led Zeppelin. Bonus point if you can figure out that the hell Stairway to heaven is even about.
7173,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m52s"">6:52</a> when you asked “What the fuck is goin’ on!?!” I swear I lost my shit!!!!<br>😂😂😂😂<br>BEST REACTION EVER!!!!"

7187,Need another Rollercoaster Shaq? Try - SAVATAGE - &quot;Chance&quot;
7188,"Classic Rock, B!!! I told yo ass this is the best shit on earth."
7189,Bohemian Rhapsody <b>**EXISTS**</b> 70&#39;s niggas:
7190,Freddy was the first star to die from aids
7191,every one of those million times that you changed the radio on this song... you played yourself. cheated yourself out of …. well... this.
7192,to show you how bad they where most of their stuff is from the 70s  like 50 years ago and it still kicks ass
7193,"The meaning behind him saying I just skilled a man, is him saying he killed the man he used to be the one hidden behind what people wanted him to be and was finally expressing who he really is, this includes his sexuality, his  musical talent etc. So when he he says I don&#39;t want to die I sometimes wish I&#39;d never been born at all, is saying sometimes life was easier when I was pretending to be someone else. It&#39;s a coming out song basically. Listen to the words and you will heaar the meaning"
7194,I guess he&#39;s never seen Wayne&#39;s World lol
7195,it is a rock opera
7196,i cant wait for the movie next month

I hope you have a wonderful and blessed day!!!  🙂🙂🙂🙂 🐧🐧
7220,All of the singing parts were actually recorded by Freddie Mercury and then layered on top of each other. Freddie Mercury had a four octave singing range and perfect pitch.
7221,"It’s called innovation, genius and epic talent!!"
7222,"Im so glad the younger generation is  discovering the magic of music from my generation, and opening themselves to other genres."

7229,That&#39;s Freddie mercury baby. Rip
7230,Ah hahahaha  u so funny to watch 🤣🤣
7231,Oh man. how i miss Freddie so so much.
7232,"I think it was Freddie&#39;s idea to have the song switch genres and break the mold of rock music. They were criticized and told by producers and others that there&#39;s no way the song would work and that no one would listen to a 6 minute song. They persisted, and recorded it. Then they decided to make the video their own way. Hired a completely different director and had the video made the way THEY wanted it. If they&#39;d accepted the advice of all the producers and everyone, we wouldn&#39;t have this masterpiece. They loved pushing the boundaries and breaking the mold."
7233,Check out We Will Rock you
7234,Freddie Mercury has the largest vocal range I’ve ever heard. G.O.A.T!!

7358,"Two rock songs that are pure-d music EXPLOSIONS you should check out are Frankenstein by the Edgar Winter Group and 25 or 6 to 4 by Chicago (from the 70&#39;s when they were a SICK jazz fusion band and not the wimpy lovey-dovey band in the 80&#39;s).<br><br>And if you REALLY want to blow your mind, Hocus Pocus by the group Focus."

7374,"&#39;That sounds like angels bro&#39;. So true.<br><br>I also appreciate your honesty, not to pretend like you&#39;ve never heard it before. I would suggest Hammer To Fall, Killer Queen and especially their best song imo: Innuendo."

7386,Yo am i wrong or do they actually say (bismillah) 🤔🤔

7388,This song is an actual masterpiece. I love it but it’s really hard for me only being one person trying to sing all the different parts but I manage 🤣

7392,"Few things for you<br>1.  Remember this was recorded in 1974  before ANYTHING like auto tune etc, so the voices you here are the band members SINGING.  It took around 2 weeks to record the operatic section in the middle<br>2.  The song is about Freddie&#39;s sexuality and his way of coming out.  He had the seeds of this song in the 60&#39;s<br>3. Watch a LIVE version, even better.  Queen&#39;s 20 minute Live Aid performance is generally regarded as one of the best live performances of ALL time.  Watch that in your own time and have your mind BLOWN  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A22oy8dFjqc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A22oy8dFjqc</a>"

7429,The song is about his struggle with suicide and accepting his homosexuality.

7447,"I&#39;m sure someone probably already mentioned this, but I didn&#39;t see it when I was reading through the comments, so I wanted to point out that Queen are the same band who gave us We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions.

We all thought and said the same damn thing in our own cultural context when we heard this the first time. .only for us we said &quot;...golly geez they sing well, do they not?&quot;"
7460,"Freddie Mercury is the lead singer. Although Queen is a British Rockband, Freddie was born Farrokh Bulsara, on the island of Zanzibar off the coast of east Africa.

7464,"Freddy Mercury - voice of an angel! He had an 3 octave vocal range, with an additional 11 semitones (1 semitone away from another octave) in falsetto. <br>Check out: Another One Bites The Dust"
7465,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKdCBZEWeU&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a> I died when he said &quot;What da hail?!&quot;💀"

7467,This is quickly becoming my new favorite reaction channel.
7468,&quot;That&#39;s a roller coaster&quot;... couldn&#39;t think of a better way to describe this one myself!
7469,"Bro I know you ain’t gonna see it, but PLEASE react to battle born by five finger death punch. You will not regret it"
7470,I love all kinds of music.  I&#39;m a Hip Hop fiend.  But feel free to ask me anytime about other stuff.
7471,This song is about Freddie Mercury coming out of the closet.  The man he killed was his old self.  And the song is him fighting with himself and demons.  That&#39;s why it switches up so much. And that&#39;s what the operatic section is.  The demons saying they won&#39;t let go.<br><br>React to more of their songs bro.  You&#39;ll love them all.  Trust me.
7472,this had me in stiches &quot;queen yall bipolar&quot;😂😂😂
7473,Cult of personality next
7474,Freddie Mercury and he died of HIV/aids and this song is speaking to him mom about him dying hella sad when you deep the meaning

7484,BEST QUEEN REACTION VIDEO EVER!!!(Don&#39;t argue with me about this 😊)
7485,"this song is about his life as he was gay, and what his feelings were, as many have thought about. This is one of the greatest songs ever made."
7486,you should listen to Fat bottom girls by Queen
7487,and young man written in 1975 by Freddy Mercury
7488,"Best voice ever, Mr. Freddie Mercury!  Sure miss him.  Great reaction, Coach! Peace and love."
7489,You should Queen&#39;s LiveAid performance
7490,Freddy Mercury is known as one of the greatest singers of ALL TIME!
7491,This is literally the best reaction video I have ever watched lol no joke
7492,One of the greatest songs of all time.  In my Top 3 along with Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and John Lennon&#39;s &quot;Imagine&quot;.
7493,I’m so happy the rock door has opened for you man! Its a great feeling! Speaking of opening doors....listen to The Doors
7494,"Listening to different genres will do this to you, exploration is paramount."
7495,Go see the movie I&#39;m going the night it comes out
7496,You should listen to some Chopin or Listz.  <br>Hungarian Rhapsody is a good start
7497,You got mind fucked
7498,react to &quot;Led Zeppelin - Whole Lotta Love&quot;
7499,"Queen are highly influential.<br>This music video revolutionized music videos, making them more of a production themselves rather than people just performing the song.  It essentially single handedly caused other bands to make them, which brought about the creation of MTV.  Essentially, without Bohemian Rhapsody, Thriller wouldn’t exist."
7500,Start off with a merry Christmas morning straight to Halloween was my favorite moment lmao
7501,"Freddy mercury wrote this song.. think about that.... beyonce had something like 4 producers, 9 writers, and 5 engineers WRITE  her song girls for her... shows you where true talent and greatness is"
7502,U wanna see tough?? Five finger death punch!!
7503,This was made when the artists made the music not the corporations.
7504,Movie for Freddy Mercury coming out don&#39;t forget lol
7505,"You just listened to one of the best songs of all time, hands down<br>Hope you enjoyed it"
7506,"This isn&#39;t metal,it&#39;s gay boy music"
7507,I&#39;d recommend a great little band called the Misfits. You should hear either Last Caress or Ghouls Night Out. But if you really wanna hear something different listen to The Cramps Can Your Pussy Do The Dog
7508,I&#39;ve watched so many reactors do this song (an embarrassing amount) but yours is my favorite. I laughed so many times
7509,"It&#39;s called &quot;music,&quot; amigo..it&#39;s SUPPOSED to make you feel all these things..<br>I just discovered your videos, and I gotta tell you, I came in prepared to just tear you to shreds in the comments section..<br>I&#39;m your polar opposite..I grew up listening to all the songs you&#39;re reacting to in these videos..and changing the station when some hip-hop/rap crap came on..<br><br>You changed my mind..you&#39;re actually listening and appreciating the music and the skills it took to create it..<br><br>I still think hip-hop music is crap..the voices are either lifeless monotone or auto-tuned robots, and the &quot;music&quot; is all drum machine and droning electronic noise that sounds like it was created artificially instead of by musical instruments in human hands.<br><br>Prove me wrong..suggest a few hip-hop songs that an open minded guy could give a listen to that&#39;d flip his switches the way Queen and Metallica seem to have flipped yours..<br><br>PS, just to blow your mind a bit further regarding Queen..you know all that beautiful guitar sound in Bohemian Rhapsody? Do a google search for &quot;Red Special guitar&quot; and prepare to be floored.<br>Keep on keepin&#39; on, I&#39;ll keep watching.<br>:-)"
7510,"lol you are changing the reaction game bro you are nothing but class, loving your work!!"
7511,"Always a pleasure watching your reactions! Thank u for expanding your horizons keep it up, you&#39;re great at what u do!"
7512,it&#39;s not a real reaction if you know what to expect
7513,Who else get drunk n high and watch my guys videos and just laugh to yourself out loud
7514,do research before you do a reaction so you know who you are listening to
7515,You should watch Another One Bites the Dust live at Wembly
7516,Honestly you have had the best reaction out of all of them...I guess I should watch the whole thing and then comment but things keep coming to mind and I keep stopping to comment
7517,Need to go see the movie...Freddie Mercury
7518,I&#39;m glad to see that every reaction channel is reacting to Queen
7519,Please watch Queen at Live Aid. Urgently! The whole video. Considered one of the greatest rock performances of all time.
7520,"Another reaction to bohemian raphsody . These reactions are getting boring . Queen was not just this song alone , they had so many hits it was hard to count and just as many lesser songs to like man on the prowl ,cool cat , it&#39;s a kind of magic ,friends will be friends , a winters tale etc etc etc ."
7521,Homie do &quot;Killing in the Name of&quot; by Rage against the Machine!!!  (The uncensored version)
7522,"It doesnt sound like rock if you think that rock is one specific thing, but that is the beauty of this genre with the many subgenres.. that it never actually sounds the same .. slow, mellow, fast, hard, soft, strange, experimental, instrumental, lyrical all kind of songs and sounds (and sometimes even within the same song). Very few rock bands sounds alike between them... you cant say the same thing for other genres.."
7523,Sounds like a christman carol 😂😂
7524,React to some Primus my man
7525,He&#39;s basically singing about him coming out the closet and the struggles he went through. He died from a disease that no one knew existed because of his sexuality.
7526,React to soud of silence by disturbed it is a  beautiful cover of a classic by a metal band
7527,SEE WHAT YOU&#39;VE BEEN MISSING
7528,"Freddie Mercury was the lead singer until he died of HIV/AIDS. After his death the band was no more for the most part. If you REALLY want to have some fun with Queen, you HAVE to watch Fat Bottomed Girls!!!!! EPICNESS!!!!! :)"
7529,Since ur on a Queen buzz u gotta check them out at Live Aid..Freddie has the crowd eating out of his hands..One of the best live performers ever!!!!!!
7530,You gotta check another one bites the dust and (we will rock you followed immediately by We Are the champions) all by Queen

7539,"Should check out Phil Collins - Air Tonight, he influenced allot of rappers including 2Pac, Kanye, NAS, and Eminem."
7540,"Sir, if you want to wake up for the week, might I suggest you check out Stevie Ray Vaughan&#39;s live version of Voodoo Child and WATCH how he plays the guitar"

7547,"The singer is Freddie Mercury.  He did all the singing in the opening harmonies.<br>The guitarist is Brian May.<br>The bass player is John Deacon.<br>The drummer is Roger Taylor.<br><br>Because I can talk endlessly about Queen, I&#39;m giving you a long comment warning.<br><br>Welcome to the magic world of Queen. <br>Queen is the greatest band and Freddie Mercury is the best front-man, ever. <br>You, like many people have probably heard Queen songs and didn&#39;t realize at the time who the band was.<br>All of the band members could play multiple instruments.<br>The band is known for having transitions in many songs.<br>No one can transition like Freddie. <br>The band is one of a few that actually sounds better live.<br>They were known for changing their songs a bit during concerts.<br><br>Bohemian Rhapsody was called the Cowboy Song and was actually 3 different songs that Freddie decided to combine into one song. <br>The Bohemian Rhapsody video changed the way music promos were recorded. <br>If you can believe it, it only took about 4 hours to actually make the video and was reportedly the most expensive video ever made at the time of its release, costing approximately £4500. <br>Although critical reaction was initially mixed, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; remains one of Queen&#39;s most popular songs and is frequently considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time. <br>The single was accompanied by a promotional video, which many scholars consider ground-breaking. <br>Rolling Stone stated that its influence &quot;cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.&quot; <br>The Guardian ranked the music video for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; number 31 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history, adding it ensured &quot;videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music.<br>Queen falls into so many music genres, that they can&#39;t really be defined by one. <br>All 4 members have written number one hits and their songs are still popular today. <br>2001 - Queen inducted into the Rock n&#39; Roll Hall of Fame. <br>2002 - Queen were given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <br>2003 - Queen were the first band where all members were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. <br>2004 - Bohemian Rhapsody was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. <br>2004 - Queen were inducted into the Rock-Walk of Fame. <br>2006 - Queen was the first band inducted into the VH1 Rock Honors. <br>2009 -

Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States (attended by about 100,000 people). <br>On the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative happened in other countries, such as the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan, Yugoslavia, Austria, Australia and West Germany. <br>It was one of the largest-scale satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time; an estimated global audience of 1.9 billion, across 150 nations, watched the live broadcast. <br>If accurate, this would be nearly 40% of the world population at the time. <br>Unbelievable, just imagine 1.9 billion people watching this performance around the world. <br>It may not have been a Queen audience before the show but I believe, they were Queen fans after the concert. <br>Freddie&#39;s voice and his charisma had the audience enthralled. <br>This performance has been voted twice as the best live rock performance of all time and watching it, you can see why. It was the magic of Freddie and Queen putting a spell on all the viewers in this unparalleled performance. <br>Live Aid at Wembley on July 13, 1985 <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A22oy8dFjqc&amp;t=1319"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A22oy8dFjqc&amp;t=1319s</a> <br><br>There are just so many great Queen songs, Innuendo, Mother Love, These Are the Days of Our Lives, One Vision, Radio Ga Ga, Another One Bites the Dust, We Are the Champions, We Will Rock You and so many more songs. <br>It is well worth your time to listen to all of Queens albums and their live concert performances. <br>This band wasn&#39;t afraid to take chances in their music. <br>I enjoy all of their albums, even the ones that were panned by fans and critics alike. <br>Just because some of their music is not what you expected from them, doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t good, just different. <br>I really enjoy and love their bluesy songs. <br>In my opinion, all of their songs are gems, some songs are more multi-faceted. <br>Some of their songs are just for fun and should be enjoyed for that aspect. <br>Come, enter the magic world of Queen, be mesmerized and put in a state of bliss. <br><br>I can&#39;t wait to see Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie. <br>There are several trailers out for the movie. Please, do a react video to the trailers. <br><br>Freddie Mercury/Farrokh Bulsara, a Legend. <br>RIP, Freddie. <br>Never forgotten and always missed."

7589,Also please try not to use the N word.
7590,"I&#39;ve always been into music. It&#39;s a huge hobby of mine. I had a small collection of vinyl and cd&#39;s,  I briefly tried out DJing and now I collect digitally and make mixes and remixes as a hobby. Before I got into youtube, pandora, spotify, shazam, soundhound etc I would buy cd&#39;s and vinyl.  I only bought one or two genres of music back then. Now I listen to so many different genres and I guess it comes with age mostly and wanting to switch it up sometimes. There&#39;s some really good music out there if you&#39;re willing to give other genres a chance. You wont know until you try. I&#39;m glad you experienced the awesomeness that is Bohemian Rhapsody and shared your reaction with your musical family ... J"
7591,"This song is about Freddie coming finally coming out. The man he kills is his old self who had to hide his lifestyle from his religious mom. It took him 10 years to write this song and is a mix of Opera, a Ballad and Rock. It spent 9 weeks at #1 in the UK something the Beatles never achieved."
7592,Legend that is freddie mercury .......
7593,React to Slipknot Duality please!
7594,LOVE your reaction.  Very enthusiastic!  Always fun watching someone discover Queen for the first time.
7595,Keep doing what your doing love the reactions💯
7596,One of the greatest songs ever in my opinion ... J
7597,"They sound like angels? All that harmonising is just Freddie multi tracked. Thumbs down for stopping in the guitar solo. Try using your ears more and your mouth less. Also, pull your pants up, nobody wants to see your underwear."
7598,Freddy mercy is his name
7599,"Freddie&#39;s a G.o.a.t. to, react to Dont stop me now from Queen plz, the lyrics are booming"
7600,"Welcome to the greatness that is Queen my friend, they have so so many amazing songs.<br><br>The singer is called Freddie Mercury.<br><br>Your face at the end, one of pure amazement at what you have just witnessed 😂"
7601,You want to listen to different genres of music. Listen to Chris Stapleton. You won’t find a better Country singer with soul in his voice. Check it out
7602,This song has no ghost writer.
7603,A legend
7604,Would love to see your reaction to another brick in the wall by Pink Floyd. Check the vid and song out.
7605,you learning bro!!!!rock music is amazing!!! you got me feeling good and laughing watching you learn about this shit.
7606,"If you are in touch with your emotions and not afraid to show them, it is very complex and you are sad, happy, angry and feeling love ALL AT THE SAME TIME with this song. He is talking to his mom and its all super complex. Its awesome to see you liking music you never really listened to before and liking it. Dont be ashamed, be proud and happy. Keep it real. I know you will."
7607,Freddy Mercury was an amazing vocalist. He will be missed. Taken too soon.
7608,I think you should check out Portishead “Wandering Star” or “Western Eyes”. British band from the 90s. Keep Rocking!
7609,"Freddie Mercury died of AIDS-related pneumonia on 11/24/1991. He was 45 years old. Considered by MOST to be the greatest front man, and singer, in rock history. There is a movie coming out on November 2, 2018–“Bohemian Rhapsody”. It’s the story of QUEEN."
7610,What makes this song even more powerful is the debate about whether it was freddie coming out as being bisexual or being upfront about the fact that he had Aids and knew he was going to die. After all he never did interviews.
7611,This video was awesome shaq! Loved this song for a long time and its awesome to &#39;experience&#39; it again through someone elses eyes/ears/thoughts. Keep it goin coach!!
7612,&quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; Lmao
7613,"an advise.. you want to continue to be suprised ??? keep listening of queen... its the to top the piramyde in music.  super reaction,... hahahahahaha"
7614,When is he calling out Jarule😅
7615,Freddy mercury
7616,Reactin to queen bro??? Damn like the diversity
7617,This is the best reaction I already saw for this song and this is a great song.
7618,"back in black, ACDC"
7619,You absolutely HAVE to react to Tool man. And killswitch engage.. and lamb of god.. Bullet for my valentine... so much potential... D:
7620,"if you want something really unique and different you should check out Pink Floyd. they&#39;re a UK progressive rock band. the vibe is mellow and chilled out, but the sounds are strong and create an emotional journey like no other in rock. they&#39;re nothing like other rock bands. the album &#39;dark side of the moon is the 3rd biggest selling album of all time. their concert called PULSE is IMHO the greatest live show ever. some of it is very slow, but powerful. david guilmor is their lead guitarist and his solos are very emotional and never long enough. the track, &#39;Time&#39; is a good place to start. the live PULSE version is great. &#39;shine on you crazy diamond&#39; is a beautiful track.  &#39;coming back to life&#39; is one of my favourites. you&#39;ll either hate them or love them so much it&#39;ll grab hold of you and won&#39;t let you go."
7621,can you do queen these are the days of our lives his last video before he died of aids
7622,You need to cover LED Zeppelin. When the Levee Breaks. <br>You won’t. E disappointed.
7623,"Hands down, best guitar solos/sound of all time, is Brian May. May is my fav. guitarist of all time, and that&#39;s saying something."
7624,nice one. this was voted the UK&#39;s favourite single of all time.
7625,10/10 for the roller-coaster ride shaq
7626,The Legend Freddie Mercury
7627,If you wanna chill like you&#39;ve never chilled before try out PINK FLOYD. You&#39;re ready. I know you like pausing because you like to discuss. I&#39;m cool with that... But prepare yourself for a lot bad comments about that from fans. Bands like QUEEN and PINK FLOYD were progressive rock. Which means they switched and borrowed and even invented styles of rock into something everyone could relate to ... Which made them both tamer AND  more far out than other music. Emotionally... They often utilize two conflicting feels at once. Like the depression and rage in Bohemian rhapsody. Try pink Floyds &quot;comfortably numb&quot;. It is a combination of fear and dread conflicting with bliss and contentment. It is a bit slow. But it&#39;s emotionally a warp speed journey.
7628,"Great reaction, try Queen doing &quot;Under Pressure&quot; live at Wembley or &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; Live at Montreal or the official video.  Either way more Queen!!"
7629,"Shaq, you killed me when you called Queen bipolar, my lungs started to hurt from the laughter 😂😂<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thatstough"">#thatstough</a>"

7637,Merciii j adore ta reaction😉 ( from de france )
7638,Please do more reactions on Queen 🔥🔥
7639,You need to react to Fat Bottomed Girls by Queen
7640,"If you&#39;re listening to Queen, I got three words for you. <br>Fat. <br>Bottomed. <br>Girls. <br>Because it&#39;s by Queen and it&#39;s called &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;. How can you not want to listen to that?"
7641,angels are really demons of course...
7642,You really need to react to PINK FLOYD trust me.
7643,"Ill Bill - My Uncle, go get dem bars"
7644,RIP Freddie Mercury
7645,"You don&#39;t know the half of it. That beautiful 4 part harmony was done by the lead Singer Freddy Mercury all by himself but, on four different levels. R. I. P.  Freddy. I personally think he was saying goodbye to all of us with this parting gift."
7646,Oh my word. You reaction is to die for🤣🤣😂😂😂😂brilliant!!!👏👏👏welcome to my world
7647,"Hey by the way, where is that guitar?!"
7648,Just love your reactions! Haha

7650,Got a new sub right here
7651,Please react to Hotel California by Eagles....CLASSIC
7652,43 years old and still better than mumble rap!  Awesome.
7653,One of the greatest songs EVER!!!!!  Hands down.
7654,"Hands down, Queen is arguably the greatest rock band of all time..they have it almost all on their sleeves-mellow, hard, theatrical, progressive, a pinch  to a spoonful of metal at times..and having one of the greatest frontman, if not he&#39;s the greatest of all time, Freddy Mercury..try to watch some of their live shows especially their LiveAid 1985 performance and see how he and the group controls the crowd..magnificent! 😄"
7655,Big shaq another uk rock band pink Floyd - another brick in the wall  it will blow ur mind enjoy
7656,Queen is great.  You should also give Pink Floyd a try.  How about a song called &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; or &quot;The Wall&quot;.
7657,"Bro I just watched this one and the Metallica one. There’s bars to be broken down in both, real deep stuff. If any song deserves a wiki look up, its this one."
7658,Try listing to ACDC&#39;s Thunderstruck. I think yyou might like it
7659,&quot;Garden Of Eden&quot; - Guns N&#39; Roses dude!
7660,I tried to hit a blut and laughed so hard i choked when he kept freaking out on the switch ups 😂
7661,"I&#39;ve notice how you&#39;ve started doing rock reviews! My opinion Jimmie Hendrix was the best guitarist of all time!! My reasoning is that he was left handed and they didn&#39;t make left handed guitars back then so he strung the guitar from bottom to top and flipped it upside down!! Check out voodoo child, purple haze or when he played the star spangled banner at Woodstock! O yeah and he happened 2 be a black man. Crazy how you say the best rapper is a white man but one of the best ever 2 pick up a guitar was a black man! Check him out!!"
7662,The lyrics are about Freddie telling his mother that he was bisexual.
7663,"yeah shaq,one of the best  this one<br><br>oh btw you should listen to stan 8D version on headphones"
7664,The lead singer is Freddy Mercury.  Unfortunately he passed away from AIDS in the 90&#39;s.  His diagnosis of the terrible sickness helped to shed some light on a disease people did not know alot about at the time.<br><br>The reason the song sounds so different in parts is because they had 4 pieces of different songs.  They were having trouble fleshing out each part as an individual song so they decided to experiment and mashed them all together.
7665,Do another one bites the dust by queen
7666,"You just listened to God!...nothing more,nothing less ;)"
7667,"Best reaction yet. Now listen to Freddie and Co. at Wembley 1985 in The Live Aid Concert doing Under Pressure or Radio Ga Ga with the 72,000+ ( more like 110,000 !!!!_ crowd participating. my friend.<br>Great reaction and I have subscribed..."
7668,Once again Shaq...I love your hip hop content...but I am soooo glad your doing other music!!!!I watch your channel way more now...cause I personally love ALL MUSIC!!So...if you do it..I will watch it bro!!!!!
7669,You absolutely need to see this performed live. Just to see how Freddie controls the crowd! You need this in your life
7670,Welcome to a Rock Opera :)
7671,"One of the greatest bands in rock with one of the greatest singer/performers in rock, Freddie Mercury may he RIP. I&#39;m sure you know many of their songs, you just don&#39;t know that you know many of their songs. Great reaction. At one point we all had a similar reaction to that song. I was 11 years old a long time ago when I first heard it. Blew me away."
7672,"The fuck,  you never heard queen before. Fantastic group."
7673,U want bars from a rock band? Check out ghost by badflower.  Crazy song about suicide
7674,"Thats why its called a Rhapsody, Queen is unique in their genre. They made songs for movies, song about fat bottom girls and song about Bicycle just because he saw the Tour de France out of his hotel room in France."
7675,@nolifeshaq you should listen to Linkin Park and Jayz
7676,"Queen is a very interesting band, usually known for being very experimental with their sound, with no two hits sounding the same, talented musicians, and massive live productions.  In fact I don&#39;t know the exact facts, but the amount of production work that went into Bohemian Rhapsody is incredible.  I think the main goal of that song was to create a rock song that feels like a full on opera production, where the song tells a story and takes the listener through a journey."
7677,PIANO &amp; SINGER: FREDDIE MERCURY<br>BASS: JOHN DEACON<br>GUITAR: BRYAN MAY<br>DRUMS: ROGER TAYLOR
7678,"Maybe RUSH Der Trommler?? (drum solo from a Germany concert 2004) <a href=""https://youtu.be/2q0cfVP3cpM"">https://youtu.be/2q0cfVP3cpM</a>"

All have rock and rap alements to multiple songs"

Comfortably Numb, Time, and Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 should get you started 😎 If you really want to understand them though, listen to Pink Floyd albums instead of just songs 👍"
7704,In this song he is dieing of HIV
7705,"Yo shaq. React to Rage Against the Machine - Take The Power Back. It&#39;s time for you to check something in the middle between rock, metal and rap.

7752,"I don&#39;t wanna come on here and put down rap and hiphop because I know tonnes of people enjoy it, so there must be something to it. But I am totally in doubt that any rap/hiphop song can shock me or energise me as much as rock music does to you in this video. I&#39;ve heard a fair variety of hiphop, all the classics at the very least, and I do rate alot of them, some are good songs, but I can&#39;t see myself being mindblown by any of it. Please suggest some tracks to listen to if they are out there, cause id love to feel like the dude in this video. It&#39;s the most amazing feeling to hear a great song for the first time."

7780,"That&#39;s the beauty of rock, and by extension, metal, my friend. There are no rules. Only creativity and attitude. Incorporate other genres. Switch it up. Be complex, or be simple. It&#39;s whatever you want. Just bring the energy. Race/religion/sexuality/gender are inconsequential. It&#39;s got something for everything."
7781,Freddie Mercury was amazing. He could hit notes nobody on earth could do to this day. He died of AIDS...freaking sad. He should still be here.

7977,"Not only did I laugh at your reaction so fucking hard but same bro. Lmao 😂 seriously though what people miss was this was metaphor for the aids Freddie was dying from. Changes the whole view of this song, makes it that much more emotional and so much more sense.

8059,Lol good one shaq
8060,"(artist)Sevendust-(song)Black, with the quickness. Won&#39;t regret."
8061,"Hey No Life Shaq, it&#39;s awesome to watch you as you discover the joy and wonderment of metal and rock and roll, and your reactions to them are like the joy you get from watching a kid have their first taste of icecream, minus the cold headache! <br>Anyways, if I remember right, bohemian rhapsody is what is called a &#39;rock ballad&#39;, another famous rock ballad that comes to my mind is Hotel California. Also Queen is a good band to keep digging into with your listening.<br><br>As you listen to more metal and rock, especially Metallica and rock ballads, you get a lot of stories, and they will take you on a musical and emotional rollercoaster as you listen. They can be like plays on a stage with all the parts a play would have, they can act as stories of fictional characters, people they know, or of their own experiences.<br>I put a (mostly) Metallica list on one of the previous metal videos, so if you see this and like it, try finding that list, too! Just in case you read this but not the other.<br>Anyways, happy listening!"
8062,Linkin Park - Giving up
8063,"Queen, and Freddy Mercury? Legends. Amazing voice, and incredible songs. So many to choose from with this band- I love Stone Cold Crazy, hard enough to have been covered by Metallica, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, sounds like it could have been sung by Elvis, anthems, studio rock, ballads... lots to choose from."

8122,"I just saw Queen live with a different singer since Freddie Mercury passed away and while the show was AMAZING it wasn’t as amazing as it could have been because as much as I love Adam Lambert as the front man, he’s no Freddie Mercury. Freddie Mercury is undoubtedly one of the best singers of all time."
8123,One of the greatest songs of all time 👌🏽
8124,"This song was about him coming out as a gay, i am not sure but it might be the time when he got aids too, but for sure it was a bout him admitting he&#39;s gay, the man he killed was previous he who pretended to be straight, something like that."
8125,Maaaaaanm you are listening the greatest frontman of all time. The legend Freddie Mercury! You must listen to all his live performances &amp; recordings. Look for the concert of queen at the Wembley &amp; at the Live Aid 1985! INCOMPARABLE VOICE!

8174,React to Blue Oyster Cult - Don&#39;t Fear the Reaper
8175,"&quot;Freddie [Mercury] had the whole piece pretty well mapped out, as I remember, but he didn’t have a guitar solo planned. So I guess I steamed in and said, ‘This is the point where you need your solo, and these are the chords I’d like to use.’ The chord progression for the solo is based on the verse, but with a slight foray into some different chords at the end, to make a transition into the next part of the song. I’d heard the track so many times while we were working on it that I knew in my head what I wanted to play for a solo. I wanted the guitar melody to be something extra, not just an echo of the vocal melody. I had a little tune in my head to play. It didn’t take very long to record.&quot;"

One track you could be listening to rock n&#39; roll, the next track you could be listening to funk, the next could be pop, and so on an so forth.

8381,"Now you know why so many people say they listen to everything. There&#39;s a lot of good music out there bro. Got to give everything a chance. Queens lead singers Freddie Mercury. Arguably the best frontman for a band of all time. All those changes in the speed, Rhythm, sound of the song are called Dynamics Changes bro. Dynamics changes can really swing your emotions and impact your listening experience. The sound swaying from left to right in your headphones is called &quot;panning&quot; the music. It&#39;s possible when recording in stereo. You can make the sound of a songs balance change from left to right (or fade front to back if you&#39;re in a full surround sound setting). Very common and extremely effective tool in recording. So glad you&#39;re broadening your horizons bro this is a really great reaction video!! Much respect for you giving different genres a chance. See now you&#39;re not a hip hop fan. You&#39;re becoming a MUSIC FAN!! Music is awesome brother. Rock on my dude."

8486,You should listen to some Hollywood Undead
8487,"Queen covers so many genres that they are almost a genre of their own.  From Metal (Stone Cold Crazy) to Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll (Crazy Little Thing Called Love), Blues (My Melancholy Blues), Ragtime (Seaside Rendezvous), Ballads (You Take My Breath Away) and everything in between.  Not to mention world famous anthems like We Will Rock You, We Are The Champions. Film soudtracks like Flash Gordon and Highlander.  Also Freddie sang with opera singer Montserrat caballe.  There wasn&#39;t much Queen couldn&#39;t/didn&#39;t do.  Of course there was also their legendary set during the Live Aid &#39;85 charity concert which is recognised as one of, if not the best live rock performance of all time.<br><br>Have to admit I also have a soft spot for Death On Two Legs, which was written by Freddie, supposedly when they discovered their manager at the time was screwing them over, which was why the band was almost broke.  Let&#39;s just say the lyrics give the impression that they weren&#39;t too happy with him Lol."
8488,You got to react to Pink Floyd - Great Gig In the Sky
8489,Do fat bottom girls by queen man

8534,This has been one of my favorite reactions by you
8535,check out Marilyn Manson coach you&#39;ll love it please please
8536,"Supposedly the saying about this song is that the lead singer, Freddie Mercury, made this song about his coming out to his family &amp; fans. He came from a very religious family it was about killing his image of the perfect son, perfect performer and coming out as the gay man. Although he never admitted it publicly. Ar least not that I have ever seen. I&#39;m a a huge Queen fan!!!! lol"
8537,This is MY SHIIIIIIT ❤️
8538,"Also couldn&#39;t help but notice all of the Rage Against the Machine comments as well. Bro that band is sooooooooooo incredible. Truly amazing how they mix rap with metal. Killing in the Name, Sleep Now in the Fire, or their cover of Cypress Hills How I Can Just Kill A Man are all fantastic. And if you end up liking Rage I&#39;d say check out Hollywood Undead as well. Regardless once again love what you&#39;re doing bro and great suggestions from everyone!"
8539,"Rainbow-Stargazer<br>Ronnie James Dio sings like nobody else. He even formed another band called Dio so listen to Jesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost by him as well. It’s so heavy"

8541,"Hahaha, that was one of the funniest reactions I&#39;ve seen yet"
8542,I asked for this when you did your first Metallica reaction; it is definitely an emotional roller coaster - much like Freddie&#39;s own life. I&#39;m glad you finally didn&#39;t turn it off when you heard it :)
8543,Everyone has to hear this once in their life.Well played .
8544,He said Queen are bipolar😂😂😂

8547,Yo the text in preview is crazy.
8548,"check out some pink floyd. good ones are Time, High Hopes, Comfortably Numb, Money, Have a Cigar, Wish you were here. anything by them is a gem to be honest. Love the videos and its great to see you expanding your genres. keep goin coach!"
8549,Go watch Wayne&#39;s World and you&#39;ll see them play this song and rock out to it. Not to mention you will laugh the whole way through.
8550,‘These boys came from a happy Christmas morning to Halloween real quick’ 😂😂😂 that made me laugh haha
8551,RIP Freddy Mercury.  Queen was so far ahead of their time they changed the game on so many levels.  And truly there will never ever be another band like Queen or another front man like Freddy Mercury.  They truly are legends.  Often imitated but never duplicated.
8552,Schism by Tool. Being that you&#39;ve been doing metal lately

8557,I&#39;d suggest you listen to hammerfall glory to the brave  or masterplan spirit never die
8558,"I am so glad that you reacted to this, I have been hoping you would. Interesting fact is the harmony at the beginning is actually all Freddie Mercury singing. He just overlayed his voice multiple times. Dude had the most insane range. Please react to more Queen, they are arguably the greatest rock band of all time."
8559,"Lol, I don&#39;t think that they have ever been called bipolar 😁"

8567,React to &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; by Krayzie Bone. It&#39;s kind of a response to Rap God. Same beat as Rap God. I cant decide which song is better or who goes harder. Eminem or Krayzie Bone.

8575,"If you&#39;re going to dive into Tool, Vicarious or 46&amp;2 are good tip in points. You should wait though, it will ruin music for you. It will set the bar too high, lyrically, musically, and conceptually for you to see other bands the same way. As I&#39;ve seen in other comments, you don&#39;t listen to Tool. You experience Tool."
8576,I was like WTF he&#39;s reacting to Queen? Fucking killed me the whole way through. Respect
8577,Freddy Mercury is legendary!! Love this!

8604,We wanted to see ur reaction when all the switches happened without you expecting it homie
8605,The theory to this song is it&#39;s Freddy&#39;s battle with himself in coming out of the closet. Freddy was gay and sadly passed away from AIDS. When freddy wrote these songs he never said what the meaning was because music is interpreted differently by everyone. So it&#39;s up to the listener to decide what these songs mean to them. Freddy Mercury and Queen were and still are one of the greatest bands in rock history
8606,React to System of a Down &quot;Chop Suey&quot;
8607,"Jinjer Pices Live Session, but don&#39;t do any research and you won&#39;t regret it."

8614,⚡️React to Wherever I May Roam- Metallica⚡️
8615,"This was amazing. Iam crying, for real."
8616,"Freddie Mercury is the lead singer of Queen. One of the GOATS.<br><br>Seriously, if you&#39;re about to get into queen, prepare to have your fucking mind blown. Hes was so incredibly talented! <br><br>He unfortunately died of AIDS. It was one of the catalysts for the insane amount of medical research that went into finding a treatment/cure for it."
8617,Is this actually the first time you’ve listened to this? Damn
8618,The singer is the majestic freddy mercury

91,"Honestly, songs should be about love, friendship, and the artist themself. I’m not saying no rap/hip hop is not allowed or you can’t swear. I’m saying that you should put your heart into a song and tell a story within your song. Have a good day :) (sry if that sounded passive aggressive)"
92,The first song was culture and there saying it’s weird

102,The first video wasnt even that explicit. Maybe I am desensitized
103,It’s literally 2 in the morning and DYINGGG😭😭
104,"People, some people are offended by cursing and some people aren’t. You don’t need to go around calling people 5 year olds or narrow minded people if they are offended and you don’t need to call people who use them insensitive. We should just respect what people wanna do cuz at this point it’s just immature to insult someone if they have different opinions."
105,NICKI THE QUEEN

164,"Pls get them to hear pills n potions or sum, cuz pretty much everything u showed them is going into her &quot;more sexual songs&quot;category"
165,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFChuq6piZ8&amp;t=8m10s"">8:10</a> hahahahahahahahahahahhahahaha eminem and drake are scared to even mention the queen of rap in their song AND WE TALKIN BOUT DISSIN, cmon thats not gonna happen in this universe ma&#39;am"

177,That woman in red is a whole Karen
178,These elders r slow💀
179,Y’all needa do more Nicki vids
180,"“is she a goddess or something”<br>yes, shes a whole generation"
181,"People in the comment section are getting offended at these elders reacting negatively to Nicki Minaj. Well, obviously they&#39;re going to be shocked and displeased because they&#39;re from a different generation and not used to this much sexuality or profanity. It wasn&#39;t normal back then...."
182,The way Robert said he liked her sounded creepy af
183,i feel like ppl say Nicki show “to much skin” bc she was the first ever woman to actually be in the rap game well the only relevant because nobody says nothing about cardi and then when Nicki does it “oh she’s fake” it’s only sexual if you see it that way and if your actually sexualizing her.
184,"Sorry gracelyn but, NOT THE BANGYANGGGG"
185,“Not sure if we’re doing something for a shampoo”<br>Had me 💀😆😆😂😂
186,"Don&#39;t blink sir, don&#39;t blink🙏🏼"
187,The black elders were feeling it no cap... They were honest
188,Blue shirt lady is respectful. Like she goes beyond the cursing and actually shows interest. She doesn&#39;t show mad disrespect just cause of what nicki says and wears.
189,lady in red is a queen
190,They&#39;re 100% right
191,i want to fight an old person now
192,I never realised that barbie dreams could have so many bleeps
193,"Why don&#39;t you play pills and potions, dear old barbie, crying game, I lied, grand piano?????????????? Seems like you&#39;re only playing music that you hope will get a bad rap"
194,They all look like they only do missionary except for that black lady in blue 😂😂😂
195,To the elders yes she does show body yes but she’s a symbol for women to show what they want to not care about what people say
196,“good gravy!”<br>why is everyone sleeping on this?
197,"“That’s Airyayna.” - Lady from elders react<br>(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFChuq6piZ8&amp;t=2m39s"">2:39</a>)"
198,bretty sure nobody likes nicki any ways lmao

212,WE LOVE NICKI MINAJ FOR BEING SO ICONIC AND QUEEN OF RAP
213,"Who is this Libby? Jeez, it seems she&#39;s new to this world, she&#39;s offended by every &quot;vulgar&quot; word. She looks like she&#39;s from the Crystal generation"
214,Super Bass should have been on here

225,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFChuq6piZ8&amp;t=7m10s"">7:10</a> <b>no truer words have been said</b>"
226,I’m not sure why people in the comments are so upset at the elders speaking their minds. That’s why most people wanna watch this cause they know the elders are so old school. That’s why most of us want to watch this cause we know they’ll be so appalled.<br>I love this series and I love elderly people. ❤️
227,But I love Nicki 😂
228,Robert: “Is that Nicky? Yeaaahhh I likeyy” 😂
229,"If you call Nicki Minaj, the amazing, gorgeous, talented, Generous Queen tasteless.... You are not allowed to express your opinion."

270,LMFAO!!!! WT-
271,"I don’t feel like this is fair tho... They should have shown grand piano, crying game etc"
272,Did anybody else know Odell Beckham  was in a music video cuz I didnt
273,It&#39;s funny because Barbie Dreams is the best song on there and one of the few Nicki Minaj I can listen to
274,f those boomers girl bye
275,This is what we call untalented
276,Nicki Minaj: Queen of New York<br>Biggie Smalls: King of New York<br>Tekashi 6ix9ine: Semi-King of New York
277,The person who said Barbie dream is trash has no taste in music
278,I don&#39;t know why  but I&#39;m embarrassed about elders watching niki minaj mvs😂
279,"I like how all the guys eyes were just glued to the video and was mostly silent, compared to the women reacting lol."

284,They all live in the Stone Age......
285,“Good Gravy” <br><br>-Awesome elder
286,"Please react Lathi song from Indonesia, the song is viral"
287,I feel like the elders actually get distracted by the music video then hear and listen to the music less affecting their opinion
288,I love the black man! He’s hilarious 😂 “ she the sexiest woman on the planet...”  “I love this...”
289,&quot;yeah I like it&quot; <br>Me: sips juice quietly
290,"&quot;What is she? Like, some goddess or something?&quot;<br>Oh, yes honey. She <b>is.</b>"
291,if a guy was cursing is a rap song .. they would have a whooooole other opinion ..<br>plus they didn&#39;t even understand the lyrics ..

294,&quot;Good gravy&quot;
295,When they said the dancing isn’t very good I was like “don’t come for my girl Aliya Janell” 😩😩😩
296,When the red head calls Nicki distasteful but they ain’t ever heard her autobiography
297,"Well, the angel thing isn’t true it’s Egyptian themed, she is portraying herself as the god of the sun, or Ra, also facts Nikki do be exposing herself hella 👀"

305,“ that’s a lot of skin “ 😂😂
306,no one realized odell is in the video

308,Elders react to Hot Pink by Doja
309,That a lot of skin

331,They picked the worst of the worst for them to react to
332,I wish they would show the actual side of Nicki that shows how she can be serious and actually talks about real world problems. They only showed her sexual side and the “diss” track. And they didn’t even play the end of Barbie Dreams where she talks about supporting scholars. I think they should do another video to redeem her.
333,she is the queen
334,This just shows how times change it’s actually super interesting to watch
335,The “she’s no angel” comment was so rude. The “halo” is actually a sun disc reminiscent of that which the Egyptian goddess Isis wears
336,Why not let them listen to the music that they can relate to....she has really good music out there it&#39;s just not really popular  .....

54,"I&#39;ve seen several inappropriate jokes on stuff made for kids.<br>In My Life as a Teenage Robot, more specifically A Robot For All Seasons, there&#39;s a song that played twice, which just so happens to have the word that describes male-to-male love in the lyrics.<br>In a We Baby Bears episode, in the episode featuring bird houses, there&#39;s a moment where the bears and someone else pack things. And at some point, one of the bears put a mask on a thing, referencing the pandemic.<br>There&#39;s a children&#39;s video game known as Lega Island, which as a song named Brick by Brick. Part of the lyrics is &quot;Brick by brick, Tock by tick&quot;, which can be misheard as something pingas-related by some people."
55,I&#39;m a child and got nearly all of these jokes<br><br>Edit: Rocko&#39;s Modern Life is what I didn&#39;t get

117,Dude rip old intro
118,Is it a problem that I got all of these at 13?
119,"I&#39;m going to agree with the kids. The jokes were all stupid &amp; made 0 sense. They weren&#39;t even funny. The Magic school bus one was really disturbing though. Like her swallowing what supposed to represent sperm is not cool. I know it&#39;s something else cuz it&#39;s a kid&#39;s show &amp; they go on imaginary adventures. For them to show that, they have 0 class."
120,I got all of it
121,I can&#39;t wait when these kids are teens so they can look back at these videos that they were in then they will finally understand the adult jokes and laugh at themselves on what they thought the cartoons were talking about. 🤣😅😆😂
122,“I still don’t get it 😔”
123,"See, the problem with throwing it adult jokes is it better make sense in the literal innocent way to the kids, and then the twisted way to the adults."
124,I understood everything.

738,I found it to be very interesting that Lucas believes he only had 5 months left to live out his childhood 🤔. Who is teaching Lucas that age 13 stops ✋🏾your childhood? Our children are exposed to too much to early .

1209,Is it bad that im 12 but know every single one?
1210,We need to look a lucas search history
1211,why do only two kids know it 😭
1212,I’m surprised how many went over Lucas’ head seeing as he’s a bit sharper than most of the kids.
1213,Yo me and Lucas have a birthday in the same year and I’m turning 13 next year and he said “I have 5 months until I become a teenager” so I assume he is turning 13 as well
1214,These kids are clueless XD
1215,I hate adult jokes i still watch cartoons
1216,Lucas is superior
1217,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=1m57s"">1:57</a> Yay It&#39;s Animaniacs"

1223,Why do I want to tell these kids about mating. Oh to traumatize them but also give them knowledge
1224,I am 12 so I should not understand but I sadly do but I am way older mentally
1225,lucas is on another level 🤣
1226,Who’s going to tell the kids what was the white stuff 😳
1227,I’m prob like a year older than lucas and I got all the ones he got even the last one like this should not be in shows for little kids and kids can be very oblivious too so ye these should not be there

1247,"The fact i knew all of them, and I&#39;m like 13- ._."
1248,Please when my 10yo classmates and I were watching that magic school bus episode we all knew what it meant
1249,There&#39;s no way you can still call Lucas a kid with that amount of innocence he has left😭
1250,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=1m42s"">1:42</a> that kid’s so camp, he reminds me of James Charles."

1256,Glad they’ve watched some of these episodes already! I thought this new generation was too soft that they stripped stuff like this from air
1257,Rucking butches in the comments let kids let them watch whatever they want just make sure it doesn’t affects their life.
1258,Interesting that they’re showing this to kids 😭
1259,This would be better if there was an older one who speaks his mind
1260,Wtf they showing this to kids... this is strange af

2389,&quot;Player 2? No you have to be player 1 you get all the good loot&quot; im dying cuz it made the joke even worse
2390,"Hadley has an old soul. She knows stuff even some 13 years old doesn&#39;t. The fact that she sees nothing wrong in actually saying what she thinks without feeling any kind of way, practically shows her innocence, cos I think apart from the dark skinned boy (don&#39;t know his name), every other kid knows more than they are letting us believe. And Lucas was just being Lucas as usual."
2391,I really want to see more kids react to metal bands (lamb of god)
2392,I love how some of the kids still have their innocence....lets you know who&#39;s being exposed to too much at such a young age...supervise your kids Internet and tv exposure parents

2426,I’m 10 and understood everything
2427,As a 12 year old student i understand 7/8
2428,I know some adult jokes are funny but sometimes their just disturbing and I know when I was younger and discovered something I missed I’d get disturbed. I’m 15 now and I still have that feeling
2429,These poor innocent souls

As you can see most of it goes over thier heads, while parents and young adults catch on immediately. It’s not subliminal it’s intentional, they are trying to entertain the poor parents. Seriously my poor mother ( of 4 kids ages 4 to 24) has been watching cartoons non stop since the 90s."

3172,"Lucas, you&#39;re still pure, and that&#39;s good. But know that your childhood doesn&#39;t really end till after college. The fun that comes with being a child goes on for longer than you think, even when you&#39;re studying in college."
3173,I dont get it<br><br>Edit: ok the 7th one got me
3174,Lucas from the beginning has always been too smart for his age and that is both awesome and hilarious
3175,I wonder why they&#39;ve never had Sydney on any of these...  I feel like she would get most of the jokes if not all of them.  She&#39;s the same age as Lucas but acts much older.
3176,"plz do a kids reaction to stray kids,nct,superm and mcnd"
3177,I am so glad the kids didn’t get the magic school bus one 0–0
3178,"Can you try to react to 34 and 35, and Lovesick Girls? Plllllllsss....."
3179,cant wait for the adults to react to this WAHAHAHAHAHAH
3180,Wow lol kids really are clueless
3181,I hope their parents don&#39;t watch this episode... 😂 I will be scared
3182,Oh good lord that Magic School Bus clip
3183,Yakko always say &quot;good night&quot; to the audience after a particularly adult joke because he expects the network censors to end the episode right there.
3184,bish im 12 and I got all of these I have a nasty nasty mind
3185,I don&#39;t know what it is about him but I can&#39;t stand Lucas. He just sounds so entitled when he speaks!
3186,"I can&#39;t believe ily Most did this......<a href=""http://youtube.com/c/ilymost"">youtube.com/c/ilymost</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ilymost"">#ilymost</a>"
3187,The Steven Universe One got me 😭
3188,When she said his pencil is loooong I died 🤣🤣🤣
3189,"I remember the magic school bus one, I think it was glucose but still even I&#39;d say they maybe should have left that one out lol"
3190,Lucas talks like he&#39;s a teenager already... Isn&#39;t dude like 10?
3191,"For some reason, kids will always understand butt jokes!!!"
3192,Please get teens to react to stray kids or ill intervene.
3193,Dude I was always confused by that &quot;or does he&quot; until right now
3194,Why do I watch these

3202,This episode makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Especially the adults asking them questions.
3203,The magic school bus one made me uncomfortable 💀
3204,Lucas is a cool person
3205,The white stuff was just glucose wasn’t it?
3206,I need to see when the parents react to their kids watching this haha
3207,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=6m17s"">6:17</a> that was the most clear one 😳 omg 😂"
3208,I&#39;ll never see The Magic School Bus the same way ever again after watching that...
3209,The magic school bus well they went over
3210,the internalized misogyny when talking about the girl character on power puff girls 🥴
3211,"You know, this always makes me laugh. Because those kids look so innocent and they take everything seriously. For you to get those jokes, you must have......immagination. Also, looking through the comment section, there were quite a few Karens I spotted. Calm down, will ya?!"
3212,They should react to this like 5 years later....
3213,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=7m38s"">7:38</a> idk about her, but I was laughing like crazy."
3214,"holy shit, glad they didnt get the msb one"

3241,Kids man honestly lmao

3243,I’m 11 and I got all of them
3244,When these kids are a little older you should them react to this video and see if they understand the jokes
3245,Now we wait for them to grow up and react to this video.
3246,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=5m22s"">5:22</a> BRUUUUUUUH!!!!<br>They went too far with that one! I mean, I get some of the typical jokes, but this ones is too graphic and too in your face (wrong words to say though). How they putted stuff like that on a kids show??? If you&#39;re a teen I get it, it&#39;s a typical joke, but it&#39;s a kids show. MY GOD! It&#39;s so disgusting to think this happens to a kid! I&#39;m gonna have nightmares about that scene."
3247,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=5m34s"">5:34</a> How...how was this aired? 😳"
3248,If y&#39;all don&#39;t do a &quot;Parents Reacting To Their Kids Reacting to Adult Jokes In Cartoons&quot; I&#39;m gonna be disappointed.
3249,BRUH why you people do that to kids lol
3250,React saw 9 espiral the from book of  saw<br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;M mexicano
3251,"oh no lucas is growing up, before he didn&#39;t get any of the jokes now he got almost all of them!!! i can&#39;t believe i literally watched him grow up on this show i am so emotional!!!!"
3252,Me during this video: Oh my god <b>starts laughing</b> oh god<br>I knew the majority of them😂. My childhood💀✌🏻
3253,Manz was calling bimbos
3254,Hahahaha
3255,Who is around there age but knew everything
3256,Try not to laugh at George Lopez Ta Loco compilation
3257,"As someone who grew up in the 70s, I&#39;m not familiar with some of these, so can someone answer this question...what kind of animal are the Animaniacs and what kind is Arthur?"
3258,That magic school bus one was just wrong!
3259,I still love Lucas since the first day I saw him on react
3260,I still don&#39;t get them it just doesn&#39;t really make sense and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t find them that funny. I didn&#39;t get the spongebob whatsoever and the one with the mayor I&#39;m like yeah I don&#39;t get it lol
3261,The white joke tho😂😂 <br>Did you no the white stuf was sticky and gross
3262,I can&#39;t believe Cartoon Network let the Powerpuff Girls one slide. Jesus. Or how PBS Kids let the Magic School one slide. Why do they even put that stuff in kids&#39; shows? Lmao
3263,My innocence was depleted when I saw #8<br><br>I wish you could all see my reaction right now
3264,Is lucas...
3265,That girl talking about ms bellum being sexual is fucking stupid 💀
3266,"Awwww that was great. And kinda sad at the end, how he was reflecting on growing up. Glad they didn&#39;t get the jokes, that girl was great calling them buns and cupcakes though 😂<br>They are going to laugh SO HARD when they come back in 5-10 years and see themselves as kids and what the jokes were that went over their heads 😅"
3267,"Weird watching Lucas grow. Started off a little slow compared to the others. Few years passed &amp; he became very articulate &amp; sensible (I was so proud of him). First time seeing him in a while, he seems to be with the rainbow. That&#39;s perfectly fine, just weird watching all the transformations"
3268,Nr. 7 is disturbing. Which %UOIUZGJ put this in a Kid Show
3269,I’m just waiting for them to grow up and come back to watch this video
3270,This is horrible.
3271,teens react to the exorcist!
3272,em... is it bad that im 13 and i know all of these..

3274,"Those who get that jokes, are living the time of their lives"
3275,I&#39;m glad kids today still have their innocence😂
3276,Lucas is the best
3277,Lucas acts gayish

3280,Such innocent minds 🥺
3281,"Funny how they talk about how spongebob might have that green part on the back, because I think he did in one episode. He got an abrasive side. XD"
3282,Love❤Lucas
3283,These kids must be protected at all costs and omg Lucas is going to be 13?!?
3284,OH MY GOSH THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS ONE 😨

3316,all the jokes were good
3317,This kids don’t know these? Dang...
3318,"that is NOT an adult joke, that is adults making science dirty cause they are disgusting perverts"
3319,lucas will always be my spirit animal
3320,Lucas know he knew them lol
3321,Ask the adults to react to this!
3322,this doesnt work with kids cause they dont get it. only have adults to react so they can comment on it
3323,"I hope someday for a react to World Order music videos, specially Have a Nice Day, Permanent Revolution, Singularity, In New York, and Let&#39;s Start WW3."
3324,I think us 90s kids and 80s kids didn’t pick up on the dirty sexual jokes in kids shows until we gotten older and realized all the dirty jokes especially the early seasons of spongebob
3325,No entiendo que esta pasando
3326,Idea: React to the new Animaniac Reboot Trailer!
3327,parents react to this and kids react to my hero academia
3328,Make the parents react to this!
3329,Lucas ain&#39;t so pure no more 😭😭😭
3330,"I haven&#39;t seen that episode of Arthur. So were the books dirty, but their content was clean or what? Anyone who&#39;s seen it, I&#39;d like to know."

3342,"These kids better react to this vid years later, I wonder if they&#39;ll get it then"
3343,Are kid just more innocent now a days or did I just lose my innocence too early? I remember getting most every adult joke in cartoons when I was 8.
3344,OMG THE POWERPUFF GIRLS PART LMAO I WAS SHOOK 😂😂😂😂😂
3345,"Ahh the rocko one... the funniest about that part wasnt that rocko was a sex call person, it was that a married mrs bighead was calling the number like mr bighead isnt good enough lol"
3346,"Lucas is king, live ittt 😂😂"
3347,When I was their age I was dirty minded as f....
3348,Those poor innocent children...

3377,"Please make sure they rewatch this when they are older. To see what their younger self missed.<br>Also, the reaction to their younger self&#39;s comments would be gold too. Some of those kids got me cracking with laughter."
3378,I hope these kids don’t read these comments.
3379,"Ugh Magic School Bus, how could u?!"
3380,Did one of the girls have a apple watch like abgfbrn7.14
3381,"Lucas, stop growing up omg!"
3382,Lucas is a different breed he knows most of it but he&#39;s re-wording it
3383,This is actually disgusting people for real. Kids should not be putting thought into these jokes.
3384,Lucas is smart lol
3385,Oh you sweet little angels......
3386,I think the Magic School Bus clip might have been going a little too far.
3387,"Lucas is growing up so fast, I remember him as a very tiny kid 😭😭😭😭😭"
3388,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=8m23s"">8:23</a> so in 5 months Lucas gonna be 13... <br>how come ? When did he grew up ? He will soon be on teens react I’m not ready for that 😭😭"

3401,I&#39;m still an 11 year old and i understand like half of these and not even in an inoccent manner
3402,As an adult i didn‘t even understand most of those
3403,Oh you poor innocent kids you were so lucky you don’t get some of these jokes
3404,"Can the one of the Magical School Bus be even considered an &#39;adult joke&#39;? 🤔<br>I mean, I understand the double entendre, but I doubt that was added with that in mind, unlike the others that were done on purpose."
3405,Lucas will grow up to be an independent person.
3406,Love you guys!!!
3407,"Girl: Hi!<br>Me: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYh6R4Jhxoo&amp;t=6m50s"">6:50</a>"

3416,yay i love this series 😌❤️
3417,&quot;Doing SeaWorld&quot;... how...I&#39;m done...
3418,"They’re so innocent, omg 😂"
3419,They should react to this in 5 years<br>To realize how innocent they were
3420,"All the others were innocent enough, but that magic school bus one was... something else..."
3421,I’m 13 in 8th grade these jokes are easy when u get too like 6th grade depending like how u grew up and who u hanged around with when u grew up
3422,Why Lucas gotta be so extra smh
3423,i cant LMAO
3424,These hit differently when your an adult. These flew over my head a kid I bet.
3425,#7 is a reference? That’s so straight forward 😂😭
3426,OOOOOOOH MY GOD. I NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE BUT MAGIC SCHOOL BUS IS MAKING SOME X RATED JOKES.
3427,Lol I didn&#39;t get that spongebob one till now

3433,Amo amo amo a Lucaas. That&#39;s all

3437,I&#39;m so glad none of them knew number 7
3438,ANAMANIACTS! If that’s how you spell it lol but they brought it back! It’s on Hulu if u wanna watch it.
3439,Lucas is so cute with that chain. Omg chowder 😍
3440,so happy none of them understood the magic school bus one
3441,I Think they purposely put Lucas in each of these because he gets most of the jokes so the adults sitting here going HHHH because the joke feel a little less bad when Lucas gets it and it’s like “ok at least one of them got it” and it just feels relatable ya know
3442,"im trying to improve my english, can someone talk to me please?"
3443,Lucas you impressed me to no end
3444,how old lucas is?
3445,hadley is so funny 🤣🤣

3447,Maybe dough 😂😂
3448,I never noticed that Arthur had a dirty joke in one of the episodes. 🤦🏻‍♂️😄
3449,Me understanding all of the jokes😂😂
3450,I think the magic school bus one and the powerpuff girl one were the funniest.
3451,This is very wrong bro😳
3452,I want them to react to this when they are adults lmao😳

3454,Wait what Lucas is going to be a teen !! in 5 months? what? no way!! fine 5 more months of being a child!!  that is so crazy we have seen him grow up on this channel

3541,"That one kid gets it. He&#39;s playing dumb, he gets it"

3545,"Woah, The Magic School Bus is actually a better show than i thought it was"
3546,I would love to see the parents reactions next!
3547,eeeww it got in my mouth
3548,"Yeah, reactions to adult jokes aren&#39;t really funny unless the person reacting to them actually gets the joke."
3549,white stuff. too many kids here to say but some of yall know what it is
3550,Its kinda funny how none of these kids don&#39;t know most of these obvious jokes lol
3551,Lucas is a mood
3552,player2
3553,I am literally lucaus
3554,goodnight everybody!!!
3555,When she said she had to be player 1..  ummmmmmm
3556,Hiiiiiiiiii
3557,I mean these are funny but it’s more funny when you’re watching the actual show and episodes lol. Kinda weird they’re singling out the “adult” stuff
3558,Hadley and Lucas were the best
3559,That kid who looks like one of them closet perverts trying to be innocent whereas Lucas over here explaining stuff like it’s no ones problem

3566,"aaah maaaaaaaaaaybe u shouldnt do these videos anymore... <br>like lucas said... let them live their childhood..  :/  <br>they have access to internets they will go google it out or something, its kinda eh not so appropriate I feel.."
3567,Err well number 7 I think I err...
3568,"Well, the magic school bus was an educational show after all"
3569,James charles kid is ahead of the times
3570,Lucas is starting to get it
3571,Hands down for Lucas he understands what&#39;s going on
3572,"&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just gonna be another goofy episode filled with silly jokes for kids&quot;"
3573,Bless these kids hearts.... lol
3574,I sense heresy
3575,"I&#39;m sure Lucas understood most of them, but he knows his parents are going to see this later"
3576,do the parents reacting to the kids watching these videos🤣🤣

3582,Oh boy.
3583,"These are very fun and interesting. Don’t listen to the few comments that say it is wrong to do. As someone who has grown up with most of these shows, they do go over kids heads until they are ready to ask questions about the topics. They are a good indicator of kids development."
3584,This channel is the only channel i laugh at
3585,I love how innocent kids are
3586,Teens and Adults react to 30 years of The Undertaker ..

3602,i love Arthur when i was a kid
3603,When Lucas said &quot;I legit have 5 months until I become a 🤢 teenager🙄&quot; I felt that

3855,I get it for the Powerpuff Girls
3856,"Their something that I like in kids cartoons that when you first watch them as a kid their funny, even if some of the jokes are risqué (e.g. Rocko&#39;s Modern Life), but when you rewatch them as an adult you eventually see the jokes in a different light and how most of them went way over your head as a kid hence why the majority of the kids cartoons are enjoyed by both kids and adults."

8,Sadly I wouldn&#39;t have been able to hold it together
9,Omg that looked like the spray off a 747 in a hurricane.dang will😂🤣
10,One of the worst episodes of IB ever. Americans (and Canadians) just don&#39;t get the concept.
11,Covid approved!  😂 💦
12,"What a shame, Will comes across as a humourless bell-end"
13,Will was awful. This was comedy &amp; he was being a dick
14,Definitely a pre-covid times game 😂
15,Ferrell is American 🇺🇸 that’s why he wasn’t laughing he doesn’t really know our British humour.
16,I’ve only seen him corpse on SNL once
17,Where&#39;s the A in Will&#39;s surname?
18,Funniest video I’ve ever seen.
19,Who&#39;s here from happy hour
20,"I realise will is a nice guy, but he really does a great impersonation of a prick who got sick of the joke and wanted to spit on the host :D"
21,No se porque esperaban que un Norteamericano se ria con clásicas humoradas británicas que seguro conocía poco y nada . Le hubieran puesto humor yankee jajajaa .
22,"Will is an epic stand-up guy... No Hollywood nose in the air, just full on professional winging it... Or should that be, spitting it?"
23,&quot;Thank you for trying to ease my cockup.&quot; Somebody is stealing my best chat-up line.
24,2020: &quot;how were we to know?&quot;<br><br>2013: <b>spit on each other cuz lolz</b>
25,I have never witnessed such abject failure LMAO!
26,Remember when we used to be able to spit water in each others faces before the Flandemic?
27,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=6m43s"">6:43</a> Chris just self-imploding. 🤣🤣"
28,i feel bad for chris he was just spitting on will ferrel that was proably traumatizing
29,"Put it on 0.5 speed and it’s very, very awkward"
30,"I mean when one of them laughs at absolutely everything it gets a little boring, like no matter what we know whats going to happen"
31,W Farrell did not loose his checks.<br>He spayed in a mist or sprayed target with a piss fountain.<br>Impressive performance.
32,KJ
33,thats wasting will ferrell<br>and our time
34,"what a boring man Will Ferrell is, play the game mate"
35,Will Ferell is dead inside (close up intensifies)
36,Its not very funny watching it when the other person isn&#39;t laughing or reacting at all
37,"oh precovid, oh have the times have changed"
38,Will starting to look legitimately concerned at the guy who can&#39;t stop laughing
39,wow this is what life was like before covid lol i guess hindsight is always 20/20
40,I miss those days when there was no corona virus
41,"Ah, life before covid"
42,Will is a PRO at keeping in laughter....it takes a certain person like Will to hold the laughter in.   This poor kid....Im surprised Will stuck it out that long ....
43,I don’t think I’ve ever seen Will laugh
44,"Will&#39;s spray technique is outstanding! , 10/10, it&#39;s on mist level!"
45,did someone sound check wills cans?
46,Just looking at Wills face Is just more then enough to make you laugh.
47,Will Ferrell’s being kind of a dick though...kicking the guy when he’s down
48,I Come ..
49,Will Ferrell just looks annoyed 😂
50,ahh pre covid comedy. You are missed
51,Why did Ferrell look mad?
52,Seeing this in the age of Covid 👀
53,"cause it&#39;s like Jimmy Fallon here......young boy goes up against aged comedian....gee i wonder who will break first, lol?"
54,"rather awkward to watch this in 2021, but still funny tho"
55,I see Biden&#39;s speeches were still ridiculous in 2013.
56,I love how Will was looking him dead in the eye the whole time. Just trying to break him down like he used to do with Jimmy Fallon in the SNL days
57,"I didn&#39;t think Chris liked guy&#39;s spurting all over him. Sorry, I had to write that."
58,&quot;Over now to US Vice President Joe Biden.&quot; One extra word there now :)
59,what strange times we used to live in...
60,If that happened today peoples heads would explode
61,Will Ferrell with water in his mouth looks a lot like Ron Pearlman
62,2021 Biden is president 😂
63,Paint Ferrell red and we got Hellboy 2
64,So this is how the virus spread
65,trying to make a comedian laugh whos trained to deliver his own humor cold is bold
66,I wonder who won...
67,This is a travesty in 2021 😂
68,This concept doesn&#39;t age well in the covid pandemic 🙈
69,Remember when this was just funny... <br>Thanks Corona!
70,This is why COVID happened.
71,Radio 1 is so fucking wank
72,the radio show that will wont forget anytime soon lol
73,"I wouldnt be able to control my laughter, justing at Will Farrell alone"
74,why did i think the other guy was tom holland?
75,I have a whole new respect for sketch comedy now
76,"Wow this is pathetic and embarrassing, Will was so disappointed and bored lol"
77,That is hard to watch in 2020
78,What kind of idiot gets will ferrell on their show then fills his mouth with water so he cant speak throughout it?
79,oh great let&#39;s make it more awkward: it&#39;s an honor to be spat on by you HAHAHAHA it was actually very funny at the end
80,the guy can&#39;t even look at will in the eyes... what&#39;s happening
81,"Ah, corona has changed things"
82,"To be fair... I don&#39;t think that anyone would win against Will Ferrell. If they didn&#39;t laugh at the material, they&#39;d laugh at his facial expressions."
83,Id slap the fuck outta Will for that bullshit.
84,You missed your shot to spit on Will Ferrell.
85,Who is here after biden is president!!!!
86,Me watching this on the day that Joe Biden came into office:<br><br>JOE BIDEN APPARENTLY HAS A BIGGGG STICK
87,I took one look at the thumbnail and had two thought.   <br><br>OH THE HUMANITY!!!!!<br>&amp;<br>DAMN I MISS THEM GOOD OLE DAYS!!!!
88,They treated Will F more like royalty than when Prince William and Kate were on the show - the power of celebrity.
89,"I guess Will Ferrell thinks British humor is meh, too. 😂"
90,"god idea, bad jokes"
91,watch this in Corona world is a thriller web series
92,It&#39;s a pleasure laugh out loud in the morning!!! XD
93,Ferrell just didn&#39;t get the point of it... worst innuendo ever
94,COVID says hi
95,"Upper class shananigans, must be hard not to laugh making their money."
96,2013 is trolling us.
97,Ah pre-covid water sharing. How I miss thee
98,Thats how corona started
99,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=2m17s"">2:17</a> Vice president<br>2020: REAL PRESIDENT"
100,Pre Covid was fun
101,Chris is a broken man 🤣
102,Will spitting straight at him was hilarious 😂
103,Earliest known covid super spreading event.
104,I&#39;d laugh just because of the pressure not to laugh
105,Really wanna see this in 2020 coronavirus version
106,Try playing this in 2020 😂
107,i wanns see this during covid!!!
108,Will farrell just come across as an arsehole.
109,This is possibly the biggest waste of talent ever.  Who thought it would be a good idea to stuff Will&#39;s mouth so he couldn&#39;t be funny?
110,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=8m06s"">8:06</a> the shame 😂"
111,What a stupid show.
112,Will Ferrell &#39;s funny bone has been desensitized for these innuendo jokes.
113,Americans don’t get British humour so he was never going to laugh
114,Will is just looking at him like what a little man child
115,Will Ferrell seems like a right cant
116,isnt that the dude who interviewed mila kunis?
117,Will Ferrell just didn&#39;t get into the spirit of this at all. I feel sorry for Chris.
118,Do you know how much of Will Ferrel’s DNA is on that poor kid?
119,"Don&#39;t know why this is showing up in my feed, but watching this right now (amid the Covid-19 pandemic) makes me question my notion that British humor is superior to other countries.  Should BBC Radio 1 resume this type of &quot;game&quot; after what the world has gone through would make me wonder if Rupert Murdoch had ownership of the station."
120,What an era 😂. Where we “watch” radio
121,"Every time I see Chris Stark, he looks like it&#39;s his first day on the job"
122,These innuendos just aren’t funny and it’s good will highlighted that
123,Why the hell did Will Ferrell do this? He doesn&#39;t know what the whole show is about. It&#39;s about having fun. Not about intimidating the other guy. It was uncomfortable to watch.
124,Wil Ferrell has a high tolerance
125,oof
126,I mean he&#39;s a badass but these just aren&#39;t funny
127,"ungenerous performace there from, Will. What&#39;s usually a good segment totally deflated by Ferrell&#39;s refusal to play along. As many have pointed out here in the comments, yes he is an experienced comic performer so he can keep a straight face when he chooses to, but ive seen him laugh quite along easily on other chat shows, doing other segments of a lesser quality. And, as an experienced comic performer he would know exactly how to give the segment what it needs to be great. A big fan of his work - and a real letdown to see this. And people can shut up about how his not-laughing is a sign of his immense talent and genius - its not he&#39;s just being a dick on. Probably in a bad mood."
128,I&#39;ve seen this a couple of times over the past years
129,UK humour is different from US. This illustrates that perfectly.
130,Shoulda just made will listen to himself screaming
131,"Well its official, Mr Ferrell just sucked the life outta this."
132,"Will seems like an asshole, Just spitting for no reason."
133,Troll Ferrel
134,Will Ferrell annoys me with his lack of respect Chris
135,"Everyone be dissing, but honestly, everything is funnier with cheeks pop-full of water. <br><br>I’m pretty hard one to genuinly get to laugh, but for whatever reason, its way easier when I got my cheeks popped up. Something about it just feels funny in an inexplicable way."
136,Years of learning to not crack up on SNL really does pay off...
137,"I know Will is just going to spit in this guy&#39;s face without a joke, even before clicking on the video."
138,"Guys, this is Will Ferrell&#39;s type of humour he likes to make things awkward. I thought this video was hilarious."
139,"Wow I&#39;m late but... Maybe keep Brits on this show, Americans don&#39;t get the humor xP"
140,That water must have been so warm by that point.
141,Will Ferrell with water in his mouth looks like Ron Perlman .
142,I like how Will&#39;s reactions are mostly to the other guy losing it
143,How much of a dick does will come across as.
144,&quot;you could have done it in his face Will&quot;!  Bahahaha 😂🤣😂🤣
145,The show designed to take the piss out of celebrities ends up getting the piss taken out of it by a celebrity.
146,Further proof that Will Ferrell is no fun
147,"I don’t blame Will for not laughing. None of these were funny, even for me 😧😒"
148,Hahahahaha.  I&#39;m laughing so hard my stomach hurts.  This is wonderful.
149,Beavis and Butthead wasn&#39;t funny; neither is this.  Unless you&#39;re five years old.
150,"this is so weird. the comments are so shitty. innuendo bingo is a british radio series and yet the whole the comments section seems to be American will ferrell fanboys who have never seen the series, bashing Chris for laughing. we get it, it&#39;s not to your taste, but do you think it would be funnier to have two people sat their pokerfacing? you might not not find the concept funny yourself, but when both people are feeding off each other cracking it&#39;s definitely way more fun than &#39;ew he laughed. cringe&#39;."
151,This is only funny because of the absolute awkward defeat and shame
152,This felt awkward
153,What did they expect!? This must have been Chris&#39;s most intimidating confrontation ever! :D
154,Will Ferrell looks like Ron Perlman with a mouthful
155,proof that British millennials are emotionally incontinent.
156,will ferrel didn&#39;t disappoint
157,am i the only one whos bothered by the kid not making eye contact the whole series ?
158,disgusting LOL
159,Image working crazy hard to get Will Ferrell on your show and not even making him laugh.
160,"&quot;Oh I get it. It&#39;s not making me laugh, but I get it.&quot; -Meatwad. <br><br>Straight faced, spits straight in the Brit&#39;s face. It&#39;s the American way."
161,Farrell&#39;s technic is spot on.
162,"Thanks to that guy, there&#39;s a water shortage."
163,"Will knows he is going to win, knows he has the power in this situation and KNOWS how uncomfortable the other guy is"
164,You should get yungblud to do this with his videographer Tom pallant or his guitarist Adam Warrington
165,will got triggered by the water
166,&quot;I have some spare pants I&#39;ll be happy to go....&quot; Awe he&#39;s so sweet
167,Wills hard stare for the whole time is brilliant. Obviously he&#39;s around comics and such so often he&#39;s pretty immune to this sort of thing. But the pressure he puts on Chris is just glorious.... Just this big star looking at him laughing.
168,He’s literally a psychopath
169,Will Ferrell + a mouth full of water = Ron Perlman
170,I don&#39;t know how you can&#39;t laugh at &quot;it&#39;s ate a cock&quot; I had to pause the vid to recover.
171,This was actually disappointing
172,jesus you could wave and this guy would laugh
173,Will looks like he&#39;s related to Ron perlman and Chad smith 😁
174,yeah I was looking for stuff that will make Will burst of laugh. You had to try harder &gt;&lt;
175,these two british fellas are twats
176,watch the hugh jackkkk man one :)))
177,he ruined it :))))
178,Reinforces how much i cant stand Will Ferrell. The most unfunny person on earth.
179,Chris can&#39;t look Will in the eye for some reason
180,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=0m16s"">0:16</a> that kind of screen fade-out always diminishes the comedy from a moment. It needs to be an abrupt cut"
181,"&quot;I&#39;m such a huge fan of yours, it&#39;s an honor to be spat on by you&quot; <br>Hahahahha"
182,British humor is for British people
183,This is about as funny as herpes.
184,So Ron Perlman is Will Ferrell with a mouth full of water.
185,"In the US, they&#39;re called bonefolders. When you have to give extra effort, you&#39;re supposed to &quot;bone down hard.&quot;"
186,Tbf just found this stuff for the first time on Iplayer and it was a lot more tame in this one. Be interesting to see him in the new one. Although Katherine Ryan managed to not laugh much at all
187,"You should use &quot;Chris, stand firm&quot; on the next episode."
188,This one wasn&#39;t even funny.
189,that brought a tear to my eye. that was priceless.
190,I love how Will is like ‘it’s not even THAT funny’
191,Retitle:<br><br>Idiot laughs at anything and Will Ferrell sits awkwardly.
192,"Fuck you, BBC Radio 1. Those loud ass beeps at the end for more subscribers! Are you that desperate?"
193,it would help if the clips chosen were funny
194,They should do this with will ferrell and mark wahlburg. But the host needs to play something actually funny
195,Savagery from will
196,&quot;The wettest hes ever been in the face area...&quot; GET A GIRLFRIEND...or three! O&gt;o
197,I love how will looks at Chris with utter disappointment 🤣🤣🤣
198,I didn’t understand a single point to this video
199,Americans dont get it lol
200,Will Ferrell doesn’t want to be there
201,"Did they go back in time just to get Ferris Bueller to hold the note card at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=0m15s"">0:15</a>"
202,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=4m49s"">4:49</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m13s"">7:13</a> was a journey"
203,What would this be without Will? Not funny
204,How does Will keep from laughing? He just replays his own material in his head...
205,"Some seem to take Will&#39;s behaviour as being a dick, while he&#39;s actually just helping Chris overcome his embarrassment for spitting all over Will Ferrell."
206,From 9GAG boi
207,Savage
208,It&#39;s awesome how much fun Will is having with this guy.
209,All the jokes are cocks and ball puns
210,Wills like why am I here this is stupid and just found a way to be amused. Aka He started trying to find how many wats there are to spite on someone.
211,&quot;I&#39;ve never seen an unfunny or awkward scene featuring Will Ferrell.&quot;<br>British radio show: &quot;Hold my tea.&quot;
212,Wills spit had venom behind them
213,These are nice guys... but the jokes were cringy at best
214,Will is known for not cracking up when stuff is hilarious. Bad idea inviting him
215,Will didn&#39;t look like he was happy to be in the studio watching Chris like a hawk.
216,"Damn, that kid had me cracking up."
217,I played along and i laughed at them all. Will Ferrel is brilliant at holding back
218,This is just painfully unfunny.
219,Boo
220,Who’s on Chris’s shirt
221,The mutt doesn&#39;t understand a word that was said
222,i think will meant to spit the water on the kid it looked as if he didn’t enjoy the game so it seemed like he did because they wasted his time like he didn’t care anymore u guys agree
223,Why does Will kinda look like Ron Pearlman when he has a mouth full of water?
224,Now I want to see Chad Smith with his cheeks full...Will he like Will look like Ron Perlman?
225,"Will got bored, obviously :D"
226,“He doesn’t want to wear your pants” 🤣
227,hihihih
228,"Poor Chris, eyes saying &quot;Oh, why don&#39;t you laugh&quot;"
229,&quot;thank&#39;s for trying to ease my cockup...&quot; GOLD!!!!!!!!!!
230,The fuck is this? I say a dozen stupider innuendos than this before breakfast.... I know what’ll be funny.... Spit on him XD
231,Am I the only one who didn&#39;t laugh at any of these recordings?
232,This game is fucking disgusting
233,lol Will was completely stoic but Chris lost it at every single bit!
234,"Forget the innuendos, what Will Ferrell does is far funnier than anything these guys came up with."
235,"Doesn&#39;t start until <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=1m45s"">1:45</a>"
236,That kid was funny
237,All that over &quot;It&#39;s 8 O&#39;cock&quot; had me rolling. That was so funny.
238,"omg, just pause it at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m12s"">7:12</a> and stare at it.<br><br>Is that not the sorriest sight you&#39;ve ever seen"
239,Will just completely emasculated Chris
240,Please get Michael Rosen on this show
241,I didn&#39;t think any of these were funny.
242,Will is just spitting straight at this guy  respect
243,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m13s"">7:13</a> best face"
244,"Well &quot;eight o&#39;cock&quot; was funny. I would&#39;ve ejected water on that one. Because it is a very dumb, blatant and unexpected cockup. It&#39;s the kind of thing that just doesn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t happen in real life. So when it does it&#39;s a little bit magical.<br><br>Think it&#39;s the only one Ferrell does any kind of involuntary mouth movement on. He holds it in though, like some kind of Ron Perlman."
245,It looks like Will Ferrell is just spitting the water at him in a hateful way because his face is doesn&#39;t look like he even laughed he was way to serious about it
246,"This is so cringe, couldn&#39;t they at least but some distance instead of him spitting all over Will?"
247,I&#39;m surprised people think this reflects British humour. Innuendo isn&#39;t exclusive to Britain.
248,He couldn’t look at will without laughing😂😂😂
249,Is better on the radio tbh and was better when theu tried not to laugh..
250,This is how porn gets made.
251,"None of those clips were the least bit funny. British people will laugh at anything huh? Geez...like a bunch of children in sex ed when the teacher says penis all the kids start giggling. It would be one thing if they just thought stuff like this was a little funny, but they react like its hilarious...really? Shit was dumb!"
252,the funniest one ...
253,British humor definitely has to be some of the worst humor on the planet
254,Jerked off to this harder than the Rachael Riley one
255,He looks like Ron Pearlman with a mouth full of water.
256,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=2m38s"">2:38</a>  he sounds like a frail british school boy."
257,"I might be late but have to say the terminology we have been raised listening to is not the same as theirs therefore the innuendos sadly do not work as well. Will looked more pissed off than anything after getting wet and spit in his face out of spite that first time then again to be a twat but slowly realised the fun the game meant as it went on.<br><br>The yanks comments below are way off and quite frankly out of order. So here goes, carry on enjoying boasting about your shit country with all its corruption lies deceit misery and murder while giving trophies medals awards and crowns to the privileged richest and prettiest etc etc creating the awkward divide your country does, no wonder you so much evil over there✌"
258,Slightly cringy
259,What a horrible idea and show.I bet Will could not wait to leave
260,Who else can say “I spit on celebrities for a living”
261,Gjb
262,I feel like will Ferrells trying to get revenge cause he spit on his clothes lol
263,I’ve only watched a few of these but it seems like that Chris laughs at everything no matter what
264,It&#39;s weird because all will ferrels movies are is toilet humour over and over.
265,Will just got fed up with guy laughing every time and just decided to start spitting in his face. LMAO
266,This is painful. None of this is funny...at all.
267,This is funny. <br><br>The entire comments section is full of the angriest people ever.
268,<b>He&#39;s just spitting on the guy .. Not even anything os funny</b>
269,"Will Farrell looks so uncomfortable, this video is so awkward"
270,How is this guy laughing over everything it’s just not funny at all
271,I’m American and I find this funny XD
272,literally none of the clips are funny
273,Chris: It&#39;s an honour to be spat on by you..<br>Will: I hope we can do it again :D :D :D
274,Will is a fucking atomizer!!
275,I love will ferrell.
276,Chris is such a sweetheart
277,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m24s"">7:24</a> the body language and look of shame is priceless!"
278,"This could be hilarious were it not for the guy who spits everything out without even laughing and refuses to look Will in the eye. Lost opportunity, and kinda awkward. LOOK WILL IN THE EYE FFS!"
279,He&#39;s got the worst eye contact that chris
280,"i wouldn&#39;t need a clip, just looking at will&#39;s face will make me laugh all day"
281,Will is just making him into his little english beta bitch. He gets tired of it and just out right spits all over him hahahahaa
282,Today I learned that Will Ferrell becomes Ron Perlman when his mouth is full of water. XD
283,This sucked lol....
284,I think will just wanted to spit on him
285,"The first funny thing they actually said during the playback was Loud and Proud, THEN ringing THeir own Bells. This vid was gold."
286,This was really immature. Its like teen humor or something.
287,Will Ferrel is a legend!!! ✊️
288,British humor sucks jeez
289,How do u sit across from a guy that looks like an 8 foot tall version of George W Bush with a white fro hair cut and a mouth full of water with out dying.
290,I knew Ron Perlman was just Will Ferrell with water in his mouth.
291,This is the best video on youtube.  I am in tears.
292,This was hilarious...Just watching that kid try and keep it together was great
293,got i even laughed how he said his name at the beginning with a tone like it was a question and not a statement
294,"Just imagine Jimmy Fallon in this, clapping like an idiot while sprayin water everywhere."
295,Will Ferrell  - just not a funny man in real life.
296,When Chris couldnt get through the clip I spit my beer
297,"This is so stupid, it&#39;s so easy not to laugh at all!! I have no sense of humor. Everything I heard was not even 10 percent funny. Fucking so lame. That guy is a fucking loser. "
298,This was so awkward to watch...
299,The fellow behind the panels is an unfunny dick.
300,Robin Williams should&#39;ve been in one of these. RIP
301,Will Farrell is a dick lol
302,"The concept is great. But whenever I watch these shows I feel like people just laugh/ spit on people because they&#39;re expected to laugh/ spit because people. It always seems so contrived. Good for Will for not falling into that. A lot of times the innuendo&#39;s are&#39;t that funny. Especially in a setting when your obliged to laugh. The best ones come from an unexpected play on words, not being sat down and subjected to a series of out of context funny sentences."
303,will ferrell does great spit takes lol...like a fine mist
304,None of these were funny
305,Sexual inuendos and sex jokes in general to me are a lot like fart jokes. Still mildly humorous but not at all laugh out loud funny.
306,Will Ferrell is such a dick! Lmfao!
307,will ferrell is just fucking around lol
308,i feel so bad for Chris
309,"Why just water? Spit saliva on each other....<br>...thinkin of yourself very civilized and gentle beings in the planet, huh??"
310,Will Ferrell is famous for making people around him break.  He rarely breaks himself.
311,with a full mouth of water Will Ferrell kinda looks like Ron Perlman
312,"The clips aren&#39;t that funny, but the guy with humourotic incontinence is laughing at everything is pretty funny."
313,Who is the over guy
314,this kid sucks. BOOO
315,I love that will subverts the whole premise of this stupid fucking bit and just stared this moron down and spits at him almost out of some sort of improv based pity
316,"I would&#39;ve lost even if I was deaf, just looking at Will&#39;s face with so much water in it."
317,"Will so bored cause its so unfunny, he&#39;s just trolling the shit out of the fake reactions of the other guy"
318,"Is it just me, or does Will Ferrell with a mouthful of water look a LOT like George W. Bush?"
319,Will Ferrell seemed unusually serious when spiting on the other guy.
320,Will Ferrell looks like Ron Perlman with a mouth full of water
321,Boring!
322,will is a legend
323,Spits on Brits
324,"The Innuendo&#39;s aren&#39;t funny , I&#39;m glad he just resorts to spitting on the guy"
325,"Don&#39;t worry Will, I don&#39;t find any of this funny either... which is a real shame considering they represent some British broadcasting. But luckily these two bellends don&#39;t represent our true British humour -- so carry on spitting on each other like fucking camels if that&#39;s your level of wit, ya unfunny twatsssssssss."
326,Who ever thought BBC would be a good name for there show
327,well the Britts spit in the bucket.
328,"&quot;I&#39;m such a huge fan of you mate, it&#39;s an honor to be spat on by you&quot;<br><br>Imao crying 😂😂"
329,childish crap
330,unbelievable crap
331,it&#39;s funny when costars roast each other
332,brits aren&#39;t funny.
333,now will looks like bush
334,Will was on the virge of just whipping it out and pissing on that kid&#39;s face.
335,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=1m53s"">1:53</a> I would have already lost. That face hes making..."
336,He was so forgiving when he spat on wills pants
337,Think some people who are more famous have no idea it&#39;s not a competition... think will thought he could win by not finding it funny
338,why would they keep going that&#39;s so awkward
339,this is so stupid
340,Great idea but the totally wrong person to do it with ...
341,Fuck me :D Will Ferrel looks a bit like Ron Perlman when he has water in his mouth xD
342,wow they reused half of these in their newer bingo innuendos.. wow cant find anything new for this? Sad.
343,"Will was just waiting to spew all over Chris. He was tired asf of that kid spraying shit after ever unfunny phrase... Will was just dying to spew all over him, just watch him since the start he been waiting and aiming at his face."
344,wait.. is this the same kid who had tha funny interview with Mila Kunis
345,what time is this on the radio?
346,its eight a cock
347,it&#39;s less funny because he laughs at EVERYTHING =/
348,will ferrell looks like ron perlman with his cheeks puffed out
349,The funniest part is Will being so surprised by the other guy finding everything funny.
350,"Holy fuck, did they swap Will out with Ron Perlman?"
351,stand firm with the pips
352,I would hate that.the silence of Will would make me wanna run
353,Are those Beyerdynamic headphones?
354,That little presenter guy acts like he&#39;s having sex with a really famous hot chick and he blows his load early like 4 times as she looks at him in disgust.
355,This guy fails so hard.
356,or guest who won&#39;t laugh. haven&#39;t yet
357,"love the show ,subscriber, but never laughed.new idea same show wit celebs or w/e who can&#39;t laugh!!haven&#39;t spit yet."
358,"Damn will is an ass for drenching this guy in spit water, all in his face and hair, also I don&#39;t think will understands Brit humor that&#39;s why he&#39;s winning."
359,that was just cringey
360,Put Eminem on here it would be hilarious
361,"i might have to go with this one with will, i thought its gonna be hilarious, the jokes were okay. not that great. i had better laughs with other innuendo bingo but not this one"
362,was ferrell even listening?!
363,No he doesn&#39;t want to wear your pants
364,"LOVE THESE GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MEMENTO"">#MEMENTO</a> MARKING THIS ONE AS IT&#39;S AWESOME AND I DON&#39;T WANNA FORGET EVER AGAIN! LOVE LOVE LOVE <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ANNA"">#ANNA</a>"
365,Will and Cris are adorable as puppies.
366,we need The Todd to play Innuendo Bingo
367,it not funny. he s just bored
368,will looks like he&#39;s done this before. I have never seen so much skill put into spit takes.
369,"either its just me, but I don&#39;t understand their sense of humor."
370,Towards the end it got to a point where they just took turns covertly spitting at each other
371,"This is funny because it&#39;s original and stupid, but - funny."
372,"Hilarious, how did I miss this?"
373,I thought this was funnier than hell
374,I couldn&#39;t hold it in if Will Ferrell&#39;s face was 2 feet away from mine.
375,"I sincerely fault BBC for inventing such a stupid game. Look, if you want an American to laugh at or with or whatever you got from this, get Jimmy Fallon. THAT would be an interesting competition. This guy vs. Jimmy, because he laughs at every little thing.  No joke, he must be the happiest man in the world (if not the simplest) because he laughs at <i>everything</i>. And he&#39;s on top of the late night world. What the fuck."
376,The microphone sounds like someone put a plastic glove on it
377,the only funny thing about this was that Will got so bored he started spitting on the kid for fun
378,Will is a comedian he can&#39;t laugh at every dumb lil dick joke. he was on SNL pls
379,"at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=2m13s"">2:13</a>, why is his shirt spitting out water?"
380,This was so dumb
381,Will&#39;s a prick.
382,I just realized Will Ferrel with his mouth full of water looks like Ron Perlman.
383,"Amazing, loved this, cudn stop laughing. 😂 wills straight face while Chris was losing it on that clip was the best."
384,the reason will isn&#39;t laughing is because it isn&#39;t that funny it&#39;s very minor humour and Chris is just laughing because it&#39;s his job and he wants to get Paid and he needs to make this look remotely humerus
385,Can anyone find where I can purchase one of this jackets Will Ferrell is wearing?
386,I&#39;m will ferrell?
387,British comedy is terrible
388,I could easily beat will ferrel
389,The main reason why it was awkward was because the guy wasn&#39;t making eye contact with Will Ferrell at all
390,British humor fuckin sucks
391,Kids in Africa could&#39;ve eaten those innuendos…
392,&quot;You coulda done it on his face there Will&quot;<br>Please tell me that was going to be on the next innuendo bingo.
393,Is this guy Hugh Grant&#39;s nephew or something? Jesus!
394,What a dick
395,&quot;I hope we can do it again.&quot; Hah!
396,"Oh, man. I just love how Will isn&#39;t spitting the water out because he is laughing, but he is just spitting it out randomly on purpose to get Chris soaked XD"
397,Ron Perlman without water in his mouth looks like Will Ferrall
398,I don&#39;t get what was so funny?
399,"Why would Americans find British humour funny? Their not smart enough to understand it, do you not see what yank&#39;s laugh at?"
400,"Will spits at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=4m20s"">4:20</a>..."
401,he spit on his bitch ass cause he wouldn&#39;t even look him in the eyes
402,"Oh god, Will Ferrell was just fucking with that guy the entire time. He flat out ignored the jokes and just made his own to tease someone half his age."
403,"you cant take an american and ask him to understand british humour, if its not slapstick or cheap laughs the yanks dont get it, they just never will"
404,Must remind Will of working with Jimmy Fallon on SNL.
405,Just the fact that you´re facing Will Farrell makes this unfair.
406,Will looks like Ron Perlman when he has water in his mouth.
407,British humor is so weird
408,did the other guy forget he has a nose?
409,will is ruthless what a guy. should know his extensive comedy history makes him impervious to innuendos
410,The most awkward and terrible thing I&#39;ve seen in a while.
411,I usually like these videos but this was awkward because will is a comedian and learns not to laugh. He would obviously not laugh. He was just spitting to make something happen.
412,BBC stands for Big Black Cock.
413,will ferrell looks like harambe
414,"Lol this is stupid, British humor is different than American humor"
415,"Those recordings were terrible, I would of been with Will Ferrell on this one."
416,wow will ferrell is boring as fuck
417,This whole thing was unbelievably awkward
418,Get Eminem on this
419,Chris is shit at this
420,"Wow, Will is a dick.  Just spitting on this guy&#39;s face voluntarily.  He could have at least swallowed for the guy."
421,I clicked on this thinkin my nigga Will was smokin that grass.
422,Will Ferrell is like &quot;this man is unbelievable.&quot; 😂
423,I&#39;m crying lol.
424,Seeing alot of comments below labelling this as &quot;British Humour&quot; when in reality people crack innuendos across the world... I am British and don&#39;t find this that funny personally and I am sure many  of us don&#39;t! Considering alot of the patter on Radio 1 is generally pretty sycophantic and weak... And on top of it you have heavy guidelines from Ofcom which prevent more &quot;edgier&quot; content that you get on US stations... And Will &quot;trolling&quot; the game is a refreshing change of response...
425,Those last few words could literally be used in another innuendo bingo vid 😂 This was so funny tho
426,Cancer
427,"You have to come from a sexually repressed race to find this funny. Thankfully I am british, so laughed a lot."
428,there was nothing funny.  I bet will was just bored AF
429,SUBSCRIBE NOW
430,"I am a fan of Will but i kinda felt that he was trying to prove a point by not laughing at the bits and trying to play with his own rules. I am aware that american comedians have a beef with British comedy, but man play the game instead of proving a vain point."
431,This was a terrible idea.
432,"Is it me or do the things British people find funny, not very  funny to Americans. It was hard for me to laugh at any of this."
433,"Well, Will ferrell did work on SNL. So he should be able to control his laughs."
434,NOT FUNNY AT ALL
435,Dude how is he just spitting on this guy with no problem
436,He went straight for he head!😂
437,Will is a savage dude spills a little on him and he spits twice in his face haha low key pissed
438,lmfaooooo will is so damn funny
439,it wasn&#39;t that funny.. wtf chris
440,ferrell sprays better than triple h
441,Will&#39;s face
442,Am I the only one who thought this was embarrassing or awkward??
443,"Will won&#39;t find some of this funny as he is American, this is a very British thing."
444,Chris Stark - off - of - radio 1... what is off of?
445,wow he really looked like he didint enjoy this
446,This was probably the least funny Will Ferrell thing I have ever watched. Boring and stupid. British comedy is lame.
447,Will ferrell was being a dick.  I know it wasn&#39;t funny but like just aiming for the dudes face wtf.
448,Nothing said was funny
449,Chris is weird
450,"Will Ferrell was being such a good sport, and then the other dude spit on him. Then it became real"
451,The kid has no balls whatsoever.
452,"I kinda feel like this game doesn&#39;t work as well on Americans. Like, there&#39;s a dialect barrier here, or something. I wasn&#39;t finding myself laughing at many of these, so I was like &quot;Well, Will Farrell&#39;s an American, let&#39;s see if he laughs at these. Some of these are funny, but they take me a second cause I have to account for the accent. I wonder if an American version would be funnier to Americans... Maybe it&#39;s just not actually funny."
453,GO WILL! &#39;MURICA!
454,will farell&#39;s hair looks like one of those 70&#39;s shag carpets sample you get to feel at an expensive carpet shop. but decide not to buy any.
455,I feel like Will is just spitting on him for the purpose of this video&#39;s thumbnail. Either that or he&#39;s showing his dominance lol
456,Wow. British people laugh at the smallest things.
457,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=2m12s"">2:12</a>"
458,For some reason I heard &quot;fisting a lawngerette&quot; instead of visiting .... Also I can&#39;t spell
459,Will really hates that kid
460,Should be titled: &quot;Will Ferrell Spits on an Englishman for Funzies&quot; XD
461,I did this with them from my house.
462,Will did it on purpose lol

464,Ron Perlman closely resembles Will Ferrell with a mouthful of water...
465,bbc big black c***
466,This ain&#39;t funny at all. It&#39;s just little bitch spitting water at shit that ain&#39;t funny. Boring
467,This was a fail
468,Chris is adorable omg &lt;3
469,Worlds least funny radio clips
470,By the end of this video I was in tears. I love Will Farrell and this random dude was hilarious as well!
471,i wish scotland voted for independence cant believe this is &quot;british humour&quot; omdz
472,"Will&#39;s a fraternity man, as I understand. This is really child&#39;s play compared to hazing. That and he&#39;s an SNL alum, so he&#39;s used to not finding things funny enough to make him laugh."
473,How can the like/dislike bar be so generous?! It&#39;s all about a guy with a most immature humor ever drooling water
474,"You gotta keep in mind that Will spent many years on Saturday Night Live, a show where the cast members had to (at least try their best) to stay in character, from sketch to sketch - which is harder to do than filming a movie, where if you crack up, you get to just do the take over, until you nail it. Will was one of the best at not breaking character on SNL. (only seen him do it a few times, during his 11-year run on the show). So obviously, with that being said, Will is not very easy to break, lol"
475,Will Ferral is a badass.  He didn&#39;t laugh at all. I mean seriously I&#39;m impressed.
476,aww chris is so adorable ahhaha
477,Channel 4 News Team patch on Ferrell&#39;s jacket - stay classy
478,So that&#39;s what it feels like to be sidearms
479,lame
480,"HE DOESN&#39;T WANT YOUR PANTS, CHRIS"
481,This is BORING.
482,Will Ferrell turned into Ron Perlman
483,I don&#39;t find these funny? And I laugh at a bunch of sexual/immature/weird shit?? idk :|
484,Chris is the wettest that he&#39;s ever been <br><br>How was that not an innuendo
485,Will Ferrell is nearly 50 years old... and not to mention a very experienced comedian that has been around for a long time. Of course he&#39;s not going to find innuendos funny. How did they not realize that? This was just awkward.
486,I&#39;m not so young and not British but I guess I&#39;ve got childish humor because I found this stuff hilarious.
487,scott mills said one where he says <br>&quot;chris weeing out his mouth as usual the Will went straight for the head&quot;
488,"Will Ferrell with a mouth full of water, looks like Ron Pearlman."
489,Hung like a basketball player lol

491,"&quot;I promise you, the president has a big stick.&quot;<br>So the Obama White House actually beat Trump to the punch when it came to hyping his dong. Who-da thunk it?"

493,looks like will got pissed
494,Hahaha

497,If Jimmy Fallon couldn&#39;t crack Will this dude can&#39;t:/
498,Will does not laugh at Roosevelt&#39;s comment because he knows the Navy that evolved after that President&#39;s time.  Don&#39;t mess with American&#39;s from the 50 .
499,Will Ferrell looks like Ron Pearlman when he has water in his mouth
500,Alien comes to earth.. humans are weird :/
501,"Will Ferrell is a trained actor, comedian, and improvist.  That is why he has such good control."
502,Will Ferrel has many talents including spraying water
503,wills face just says &quot;what the fuck even is this guy&quot;
504,Kids in Africa could have eaten thse DT 770&#39;s.
505,<i>Stand firm on the pips.</i>
506,Will Ferrell with his mouth full looks like Ron Pearlman
507,I love that Will just calmly spits.
508,&quot;i hope we can do it again&quot; killer
509,"I hate how radio 1 have these shite games and talk so much shite all the time, just shut the fuck up and play music."
510,wills water looks like it has turnec to dust
511,Jesus radio one is getting desperate.. they are literally hiring fucktards out of desperation.
512,This is so funny can&#39;t help laughing to chris :D
513,"This is the guy who interviewed Mila Kunis! Go check it out, it&#39;s hilarious!"
514,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m21s"">7:21</a> It&#39;s Finny!"
515,"My advice for Chris is, don&#39;t smoke quite so much green meanie before you play innuendo bingo."
516,i feel like will was just annoyed at how the other guy was laughing at every fucking thing so he just started spitting
517,English humour can be hilarious and witty but this seems to be pre school comedy
518,Bet WIll didn&#39;t understand 90% of the clips.
519,I bet he&#39;s so pissed off with these childish twats. Fucking annoying no wonder he&#39;s spitting water over that dickheads u can tell he has hate behind that spit lol.
520,Will Ferrell with water in his mouth looks like Ron Perlman
521,I feel like Will Ferrel didn&#39;t spit the water much because he wasn&#39;t putting as much in his mouth.
522,How DARE they waste water this way when they could so easily be using it to drink and then piss all over prostitutes&#39; faces!
523,Disliked. Poor Will having to sit through it all. Those &quot;innuendos&quot; are not funny to anyone over the age of 12.
524,Will Ferrell with a mouth full of water looks like Ron Perlman.
525,Will Ferrel with water in his mouth looks even more like Ron Perlman than he normally does.
526,"with his mouth full of water, will ferrell looks like clay from Sons of anarchy"
527,Your gonna need a better competitor than that to make this funny. The guy couldn&#39;t make it threw the word boner without laughing..
528,"With due respect to Chris, who could really sit there with a straight face while Will Ferrell is staring at you with a mouth full of water? You could tell the shittiest joke in the world and I would explode (both literally and figuratively....giggity)."
529,that kid has no backbone
530,So stupid doin this on radio is a very visual gag
531,"Really, how the fuck was any of this funny? will Ferrell&#39;s there and still this shit was shit. the whole time i was thinking &#39;&#39;spit that shit out at him and make it funny will!"
532,I think just the presence of will made the other guy laugh. The jokes hadn&#39;t even finished and he was spitting all over himself. Will is a very comically intimidating guy ahaha
533,:D
534,oh my god xD
535,Holy fuck are people on the internet insane. Not just for this video but for millions of others. You could more then likely find a video of a grandma hugging a child while petting a kitten and 10 comments down theirs a race war and a death threat. SMH
536,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=1m25s"">1:25</a> are spolers what WILL happen"
537,lmao u can see will sizing him up like &quot;i am spitting in ur face no matter what&quot;
538,Not funny
539,I die each time he&#39;s spitting and will just watches him.
540,"everyone saying will is a dick, gerard butler spat on the kid before the first clip"
541,How can he not laugh??? He&#39;s not human.
542,Chris just looks like a little boy getting told off by his dad
543,His body language is SCREAMING insecurity sitting next to will.
544,"Really... laugh at every single one but not at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=8m09s"">8:09</a><br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;You could of done it on his face there, Will&quot;"
545,"Will just got sick of the other guy spitting on him at not very funny innuendo clips, his payback was funny though."
546,it&#39;s not even funny
547,Will Ferrell featuring Guy Who Laughs at Everything
548,British humor just isn&#39;t. Don&#39;t get it. But Will was hilarious.
549,yeeaahh... not funny
550,"It doesn&#39;t even have to be hilarious, it&#39;s a game just have fun with it! Stop being so uptight! Bet you&#39;re all fun at parties."
551,"If Will Ferrell spit on me like that, I&#39;d MAKE him take off his pants."
552,Of course Ferrel doesn&#39;t understand many English innuendos.
553,will was just pissed the hole time
554,That was fantastic hilarious thanks!
555,None of the clips were even funny so of course Will isn&#39;t going to laugh
556,HE GOT BAPTIZED BY WILL FERRELL.  he had to pull it to next level cause he didn&#39;t find nothing funny .  this is a classic.
557,"why are people acting pissed off, it&#39;s radio 1. It&#39;s for young people. This is gold. Comedy doesn&#39;t have to appeal to everyone. Sometimes stupid shit is just as funny. <br><br>Why are people even making this about british / american humor. I&#39;ve spent my life laughing with people from both continents soo...."
558,"you should use your own clips.  &quot;You know, Will, you could&#39;ve done it in his face.&quot;"
559,Will Ferrell with a mouthful of water looks a lot like Ron Pearlman.
560,"I get the innuendos it&#39;s just at that point like dirty unintended line, now what?"
561,why the hell god damm is Chris on radio? he is like a stagnant puddle. Mills aint far off but his knees are under the bbc table.
562,That was hilarious
563,"Meanwhile, kids in Africa...."
564,Please can we retire this game
565,How is this funny?
566,I was actually drinking water when I watched this video.  I sprayed it all over my lap-top when the &quot;It&#39;s 8 o&#39;cock&quot; part came.
567,this isnt funny the quotes arent funny
568,why is will being kind of a jerk? wtf?
569,lmao just looking at will ferrell majestic me laugh
570,"Fucking unfunny <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23innuebdobingo"">#innuebdobingo</a>"
571,"the kid literally drowned in laughter, expected will to lose it too but then again he never does, nor even vs his co stars, a goddamn comedy god."
572,Gotta love will ferrel. &quot;This shit ain&#39;t even funny. I&#39;m going to make it funny&quot;! LOL
573,Can&#39;t just look at this one unfunny thing and label this as the only thing that represents &quot;British humor&quot;
574,I guess I don&#39;t really understand why there&#39;s so much hate on Ferrell
575,Stupid. He doesn&#39;t laugh because it isn&#39;t funny.
576,These innuendos weren&#39;t very funny...
577,Will has a slight advantage a lot of these innuendos aren&#39;t commonly American so he has the advantage of having to make their connection.
578,"British humour isn&#39;t witty, it&#39;s just lacking in oompf. Quite plainly, it&#39;s boring."
579,That wasn&#39;t even funny.
580,Would love to see you guys do this with Ricky Gervais.
581,the british guy didn&#39;t even last ten seconds in. Ringing their own bells? how&#39;s that get a chuckle?
582,American don&#39;t understand British humour
583,When Will had the water in his mouth he looked like the Grinch.
584,Work with Tim and Eric enough and youre probably going to be good at holding in your laughter
585,"He said o&#39;cock instead of o&#39;clock. You&#39;re right, that is hilarious..............."
586,Tbh innuendo bingo is shit
587,Well that was awkward. XD
588,They should replace the water part of it with milk
589,will is soooo shit in this...booo!
590,Will Ferrel with a mouth full of water looks like Ron Pearlman
591,played something like thos yeterday
592,Literally the only one of these I found funny... glad I decide to check it out one last time
593,I loved how Chris laughed more but he was more wet
594,Will Ferrell had a great time watching Chris lose it.
595,"What a rude thing to do, spit on the kids face because he laughed up water on your clothes in a &#39;do not laugh with water in your mouth&#39; contest.<br>At least that ego let go a bit at the end, for whatever reason."
596,he got a taste of his own medicine lol yes WILL !
597,Will killed their game. They should&#39;ve paired him up with another comedian.
598,"&quot;American&quot; humor has sunk to the lowest common denominator in recent years...I&#39;m a born and bred American, yet I&#39;ve always enjoyed &quot;British&quot; humor a lot more. I&#39;ve found there is usually more wit involved."
599,"right at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m13s"">7:13</a> i started crying of laughter"
600,will is just being a dick
601,Will Ferrell is funny in Elf and that&#39;s it
602,"So the Brits get to be exposed to American and UK humor (I mean they watch US shows like Family Guy, South Park, Simpsons, and other US comedy shows) while we Americans only get exposed to one type of humor (American)! Not fair!"
603,"He&#39;s got no idea, the poor guy!"
604,I never laugh at any of these either
605,"To everyone who is saying this somehow reflects british humour in a negative light.. innuendos are pretty standard concepts that are found everywhere. They&#39;re not owned or originated in britain.The reality is, Will Ferrell was just being a jerk. The whole point is about lightening up, having fun, not being scared to come across silly as pretty much everyone else who&#39;s done the game, (from different countries), have managed to do.  This actually just makes me give Will 0 respect as a person and comedian."
606,"I found Chris&#39;s reactions to the clips hilarious. I loved how Will Ferrell was so intimidating and Chris was just laughing away, awkwardly. :D"
607,"I fuckin love Will Ferrell... He had just had enough and didn&#39;t find any of it funny; until he figured he could blatantly spit in his face, then he was beyond amused ... How much did it cost?... I&#39;d allow Ferrell to spit on me for my next birthday... =D<br><br>Btw, people who say he was being a dick, need to consider that the kid was deliberately getting Will wet intentionally by the first line... by the last one, right before will spit on him; he was purposely squirting towards will soaking his leg... I was even saying to myself, &quot;cmon Will, just spit in his face&quot;... and sure enough, I was not disappointed... repeatedly.."
608,"Offering Will Farrell his spare pants, that&#39;s so cute! "
609,"Nice Freudian slip at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m15s"">7:15</a> ;)"
610,"This game is shockingly bad, and will just seemed like a dick "
611,<br><br><br><br><br>A
612,"Will Ferrell isn&#39;t even laughing, he&#39;s just spitting on the other guy lol"
613,GATOR don&#39;t play no shit! If you know what i mean :D
614,"This was SO satisfying to watch, because that Chris guy usually just spits it over the other person on purpose even when he obviously doesn&#39;t find it funny, and it just ruins it. A taste of his own medicine."
615,"Obnoxious, eye-roll inducing humor with the English..."
616,"Wow, British people really do have a different sense of humor from Americans"
617,I&#39;m Will Ferrell? Dammit who put a question on the teleprompter
618,Ferrell&#39;s built like a brick :o
619,Will was being a jerk?
620,"I&#39;m just gonna say it, I think will Ferrell is not funny because his comedy is kinda childish and stupid, but I love British comedy, it makes me happy to be English, Rhys James is a great comedian, I&#39;d love to see him on innuendo bingo 😂😂 I feel sorry for Chris because he looks so scared and awkward, will seemed quite mean too "
621,"Since when is spitting on someone funny. It&#39;s not just water,it&#39;s saliva mixed in with it from holding it in your mouth. Yechh!"
622,You need to get Jimmy Fallon to do this!
623,"british people are constantly saying how their sense of humor is so superior, this was not funny whatsoever"
624,loving the hilary devey jumper
625,but the clips weren&#39;t even funny...
626,"Will was a good sport, but yeah..maybe the kid shouldnt have known what was coming..that way he could have held it together just a little longer"
627,HES TOTALLY DOING THAT ON PURPOSE
628,"Having a comedian do it is a bad idea:<br>they can keep a straight face, and I find they have a higher threshold for humor.﻿"
629,He does laugh at 8.00
630,Will Ferrell = legend
631,Will Farrell with Water in his Mouth looks like Ron Perlman :D
632,ha i love that will ferrell isn&#39;t breaking. seriously. awkwardly great.
633,It&#39;s Will fucking Ferrel. He was on Saturday Night Live. HE DOESN&#39;T BREAK! All that happened here is that the BBC just totally disrespected one of the best comic actors of our time.
634,&quot;I have some spare pants I&#39;ll be happy to go....&quot; <br>Awe he&#39;s so sweet
635,Just fucking rude to be fair
636,Pointless blabber coming out of that guys mouth for 8mins i couldnt watch
637,Incredibly UNFUNNY. Almost to the point of being embarrassingly awkward.<br>.
638,"And you would think Chris wouldn&#39;t laugh so much after all of these.<br>For me, I laugh so easily yet I can control it...how is this even making sense."
639,I feel bad for him lool so awkward cause Will isn&#39;t finding anything funny
640,"It&#39;s 8 o&#39;cock, clock."
641,Will Ferrell<br><br>1967-2008
642,the humor herer is in will ferrell&#39;s aim<br>nice aim
643,"He was cracking a bit at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=3m48s"">3:48</a>"
644,"as expected as a professional comedian<br>can keep a straight face<br><br>so fun to see<br><br>take notes people, take notes"
645,blåbär låter underbart
646,To be honest none of it was really funny😐
647,Poor kid he was absolutely mortified at spitting all over Will Ferrell.
648,Chris seemed terrified.
649,&quot;its on honor to be spat on by you&quot; haha
650,"None of that was funny though, lol......."
651,Will didn&#39;t find it funny because there was no man being hit with a pie in the face.
652,I feel so bad for Chris omg he felt so bad
653,It&#39;s not funny at all... He is on some happy medicine <br>
654,Chis has a strangely a-fucking-mazing job..... spitting water on celebrities and having celebrities spit water on you :P
655,Will is an actor. He&#39;s gotta be able to keep in giggles.
656,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m14s"">7:14</a> I am crying"
657,"I&#39;m sorry for the other guy, but man this made me laugh!!!!! "
658,That last innuendo was hilarious! 
659,i laughed at every one of those .
660,nurfer dadalı 
661,It&#39;s 8&#39;o cock. 
662,Will Ferrell. Spitting on the little guy.
663,British people have the same sense of humor as I did in 7th grade lol
664,Will Ferrell rules!  British humor just... doesn&#39;t.
665,I agree with Will! watching chris was way funnier than the innuendos themselves! xD
666,I think I kind of dislike Will now...
667,I don&#39;t find Will that funny in any films either but spitting on the kids is pretty rude and claiming her was just tired of holding the water screams sore loser. 
668,You americans cant spell
669,How the fuck is that rude? You people are weird.
670,haha Will looks like Albert Brooks in Drive when his mouth is full of water
671,Like if u think this is worst ib yet
672,"Makes sense Will doesn&#39;t laugh, when he&#39;s doing comedy he has to be able to keep a straight face all the time or he&#39;d never get through making a whole movie lol"
673,will ferrel made it worth his time
674,why would they put a comedian on there?
675,they are so British haha 
676,"this is the stupidest thing I&#39;ve seen today. Why world? why another of these stupid challenges? or whatever this is, (NOT FUNNY AT ALL)"
677,Ron Perlman
678,"I just finished watching the one with Hugh Jackman, Matthew Lewis, and Daniel Radcliffe. I must admit that the clips in this one weren&#39;t that funny... "
679,"Bad choice as a guest with such tame material, it takes vastly more than that to get the Ferrell cat to squirt. "
680,This was awkward because Will didn&#39;t seem to get the humour in the voice clips and just spat water out for no reason.... I feel bad for Chris because everyone else did the bingo properly but Will didn&#39;t. 
681,This is freaking hilarious ... 
682,American&#39;s are so awful at this... 
683,Who let the elderly loose on the comments section?
684,Hilarious!
685,This isn&#39;t even funny 
686,+Rob Fraser<br><br>Lorne Michaels and many of the crew members said that Will Ferrell singlehandedly saved SNL. Id say that is pretty brilliant.
687,none of these are funny in the slightest i guess its because im too focused on the british accent idk man
688,Will Ferril is evil
689,This isn&#39;t funny this is just really reaaally awkward. :P
690,How did they get George W. Bush to do this?
691,I love british humor.
692,I need that channel 4 news team jacket!!!
693,American here. Couldn&#39;t stop laughing. Very funny.
694,oh come on Will didn&#39;t even find them funny he was just being rude and spraying all over the guys face :(
695,Didn&#39;t Wills mouth get sore? xD
696,"PERHAPS, MIGHT I SAY THAT I DID IT FIND IT QUITE UNsightly how inequolent that speech was"
697,Will with a mouth full of water looks like Ron Perlman 
698,"I&#39;m with Will, it&#39;s funny...but not laugh out loud funny."
699,This was so uncomfortable...
700,I just feel so bad for Chris the whole time.
701,I would feel awkward doing that to a celebrity! 😳
702,There seems to be a lot of ignorant Americans on this thread. Lighten up and realise it&#39;s just a bit of banter.
703,will ferrell&#39;s eye contact is intense
704,Will is so mean haha. 
705,Your just an ass if its not funny what your doing isn&#39;t either 
706,this is comeing from ppl who like not jokes hahahaha not !!
707,Matt Damon must hate Innuendo Bingo.
708,"the clips are funny but Will clearly didn&#39;t get it. In all, an uncomfortable watch"
709,omg so funnay
710,i love you.Pharrell Williams.
711,Will is too funny to laugh at this
712,this game sucks
713,lol you can just tell how intimidated he feels by Will 
714,I don&#39;t get the rules
715,The only thing funny about this is Will spewing water in his face...good job Will
716,"Will, from the side when &quot;loaded&quot; with water, looks just like Ron Perlman....freaky"
717,"Dayum, ain&#39;t that a gadam shame! Po kid! ha"
718,Just need 13
719,Putting Will Ferrell on here was a bad idea cause it is not easy to force him to laugh
720,why doesnt chris get him back?
721,The only funny thing in this video is Will :) 
722,"Having a comedian do it is not a good idea, they are used to keeping a straight face besides they have a higher threshold for humor."
723,They are literally trying to force people to laugh its uncomfortable to be honest.
724,The poor thing looks like a schoolboy who has been sent to the Head-Teacher&#39;s Office for the first time! 
725,I&#39;ve been pronouncing Ferrell wrong all these years!!
726,Curios does what I do in the presence of someone epic. Look down and feel embarrassed.
727,FANTASTIC! :-)
728,You british people have a weird since of humor.
729,will ferrell is a rock
730,I love Will Ferrell but he&#39;s trying way too hard to be funny here
731,the intro is basically an innuendo i mean.. &quot;its time to make a celebrity wet&quot;
732,"Will probably didn&#39;t laugh because HE HAS MADE A TON OF MOVIES INCLUDING ADULT COMEDY SO HE IS USED TO NOT LAUGHING ON SET FFS PEOPLE, yeah I love will a lot &gt;.&lt;"
733,Will Ferrell without a mouth full of water looks like Ron Perlman
734,The Americans don&#39;t get british humour he didn&#39;t laugh at one joke.
735,Shite
736,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m48s"">7:48</a>"
737,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m57s"">7:57</a>"
738,Taylor reid joe sugg did not create this if you saw his first video of inuendo bingo he says he got the idea of radio one !!!!
739,xD
740,he was so trying not to fangirl come on being that close to will farrel
741,"sorry but will ruins it because he&#39;s not even reacting to the clips, he just thinks it&#39;s funny to spit the water out, which it&#39;s NOT, at least to anyone older than 5"
742,Why is that clip of will spraying mist in that other guy&#39;s face not a huge meme already. It&#39;s amazingly funny especially out of context.
743,funniest actor of all time him and ben stiller
744,"I&#39;m up to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=5m15s"">5:15</a> and this is so awkward I can&#39;t continue."
745,Intro literally destroyed my ears
746,to watch this whilst having a drink and instead I soaked my computer screen
747,Haha first time watching these.. what&#39;s the funniest one so far?
748,...cringe!!!1
749,Will is like being a bitch about it....like it u dont think its funny keep it in ur mouth dont just spray it cause u get tired or u feel like spraying him with water. Theres a BIG bucket right in front of you.
750,I do seem to enjoy seeing Will Ferrell spit on some Brits.
751,"People finding it rude. Are u fucking serious thats what happens in the game. Chris is spitting all over Will. Will isnt laughin so he obviously has to do something otherwise hes gonna just sit there with water in his mouth getting spat on. He got involved. <br><br>Rude, fucking hell go fuck yourselves u uptight snobby bastards. Lighten the fuck up. "
752,"People finding it rude. Are u fucking serious thats what happens in the game. Chris is spitting all over Will. Will isnt laughin so he obviously has to do something otherwise hes gonna just sit there with water in his mouth getting spat on. He got involved. <br><br>Rude, fucking hell go fuck yourselves u uptight snobby bastards. Lighten the fuck up. "
753,"I thought that this was quite funny, Until Will started purposely Spitting the water onto Chris&#39;s face, personally I thought it was Very rude and Quite Ridiculous, If he didn&#39;t want to hold the water in his mouth he should of spat it into the bin. Hats off to Chris for not punching him. "
754,looooooool
755,This is my all time favorite Innuendo Bingo!!!
756,Will looks like Ron Pearlman at times.
757,"Is this supposed to be funny? &quot;The long stick&quot;, &quot;the cock&quot; jokes are horrible..how can anyone find this funny? Those are grade school laughs..Will Ferrell was bored..you can&#39;t make a comedic genius laugh with that garbage"
758,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=3m43s"">3:43</a> cmon that was too funny!"
759,hahahaha Love Chris Stark wtf is wrong with Will Ferrell i&#39;d be dying at some of them 
760,"Wow, I&#39;m surprised so many people like this video. I guess it&#39;s British humour or something. I just thought Farrell spitting water on the other guy was just rude. "
761,I didn&#39;t find it funny either but am I the only one who found Will spitting in his face a tad bit rude?
762,"Please me cocoa, is what he said?"
763,Dat glove on the microphone xD
764,i fucking LOVE watching radio...
765,I don&#39;t blame Will Ferrell. This is the dumbest game and I would have just resorted to spitting on the moron opposite. 
766,Will Ferrell was bored.
767,I have to agree with will on this one. The inneundos just where not that funny<br>I say that as a fan of british and american comedy and chrises reactions where funnier than the clips themselves
768,"<a href=""http://youtu.be/KyNJD8Ewcjk?t=6m17s"">6:17</a> he wasn&#39;t even laughing he just purposely spit on Chris I can&#39;t stop laughing "
769,This humour is weak as fuck...
770,LMFAO classic!!
771,"Chris was too much of a pussy in this show, he&#39;s usually a total twat and sprays people on their face but this time he was too afraid of Will to spray him, meanwhile Will is just bullying him with water, a bit boring."
772,These clips don&#39;t seem to be Will&#39;s sense of humour :)
773,no offence to Will Ferrell i think hes amazing but why does he look so fucking miserable? 
774,Steve Carell!!!!!!!
775,lol<br>will ferrel so pro
776,I never saw why people thought Will Ferrell is funny
777,"I was giggling like a loon through that, I enjoy a good laugh-shame the humour doesn&#39;t translate(shame for Will)"
778,What a waste. You have will ferrell on your show and you fill his mouth with water so he can&#39;t talk or make facial expressions
779,I felt really uncomfortable watching this. Will Ferrell came across as really uncivilised. 
780,"will ferrel ls the first decent bloke on here whos not forcing himself to laugh to bits of tv. the clips are too short theres too much pressure to laugh at stuff that isnt even mildly funny, just looks really sad"
781,"jesus fuck, people saying &quot;will ferrel is so serious&quot; and &quot;wow english comedy is so different&quot;, scott mills fucking sucks. he isn&#39;t funny. just cause he and his radio show is painfully mediocre doesn&#39;t mean that will &quot;doesn&#39;t get&quot; english comedy."
782,"Chris just looks ashamed to be even doing that in Will Ferrell&#39;s presence, brilliant."
783,Am I the only one that didn&#39;t think those audio clips were funny at all? Maybe because American humor is different from English 
784,The only funny thing about this is will spitting water in his face..
785,&quot;It&#39;s an honour to be spat on by you&quot;
786,"If you watch the outtakes of eastbound and down, will holds his laughter through some fucking ridiculous stuff. You&#39;re never going to get him to laugh in a situation like this."
787,This seems like a really bad idea… Get one of the best comedians in the world on your show and then stop them from making any kind of comment by telling them to hold water in their mouth for the entire show...
788,Fuckin&#39; awesome! Go on Chris!!!!
789,"yeah i&#39;m not finding those innuendos too funny, must be something lost in culture differences in humor? "
790,I never realised how serious will is in real life
791,the best innuendos are from the guy not participating if you listen closely
792,its 8 o cock i mean clock lol lmfao im crying 
793,boner book thing!!!!!!! lol
794,ok so i&#39;d hit him after hitting him after spitting witout hearing the joke...fuck will farrel
795,"Don&#39;t forget that Will is an actor, not a comedian."
796,"Haha, Troye Sivan&#39;s &#39;ding&#39; sound at the beginning."
797,will is such a prick
798,Will is a SNL pro!!! its that simple peeps
799,This is amazing LMFAO
800,"I&#39;m surprised dislike bar isn&#39;t bigger, it&#39;s not even funny and seeing that old fart spew water which he&#39;s had in his mouth for 5 minutes all over that kids face was pretty disgusting tbh"
801,Chris was just so ashamed hahah
802,"<a href=""http://youtu.be/KyNJD8Ewcjk?t=7m21s"">7:21</a> ha ha 😂😂😂"
803,This had me dying!
804,I think Will ferrell hate chris
805,Wtf was up with that intro sounding like a Protoss? Fucking En Taro Will Ferrell up in here.
806,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> best one ever on innuendo bingo i have no idea how will doesnt find this whole part funny just the reaction chris is giving"
807,talk about missing the point
808,"It can be funnyish on radio but it&#39;s a bit too school playground for a middle aged man..when he read the news as Ron Burgundy on Moyles show That was funny, I would like a potato sandwich...."
809,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=6m45s"">6:45</a>.... Chris having a bath &quot;this shouldent happen&quot; xD"
810,HAHAHAHA &quot;he doesn&#39;t want to wear your pants&quot; DIED LAUGHING 
811,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=5m26s"">5:26</a> anyone else see that slight moment when he wants to shout &quot;for fuck sake maaaan&quot;"
812,"Disturbingly disgusting. Couldn&#39;t stop cringing, so I just stopped after 6 minutes (what took me so long?)"
813,Americans often have a very different sense of humour to Brits so that&#39;s probably why he didn&#39;t find it as funny 
814,The clips are just not that funny and vamping every clip takes all the wind out of the sediment. I dont blaime him for not laughing... it really was not that funny. I have seen some that are very funny. Chris is more just awkward laughing...
815,he&#39;s un breakable he has to do the most funny and embarrassing things to act.. it would suck to go against him.. but at least you get to meet him and get water sprayed on you by will ferrel 
816,good shit
817,i feel like was an elaborate prank on chris
818,Some people don&#39;t realize that there&#39;s a big difference between British and American humor
819,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m13s"">7:13</a> ahahahaha Chris&#39; face "
820,so awkward.
821,Will Ferrell has been around so much hilarious shit that it&#39;s no surprise he doesn&#39;t find this silly little mistakes funny. Besides the object of the game is to see if you can keep the water in your mouth.
822,why is will Ferrell being such a dick here!
823,"After reading some of the comments here, I get the feeling that some people still haven&#39;t figured out that Will Ferrell is only as funny as his writers and, without a script, benefits greatly from keeping his mouth shut.<br><br>His appearance at the British Comedy Awards was cringeworthy (the only good thing to come out of it was Johnny Vegas&#39; comment: &quot;Tonight is not about slagging off the sponsors or giving an international award away to someone just because he was here.&quot;)<br><br>So congratulations to Radio 1 for giving us the <i>least unfunny</i> Will Ferrell public appearance of the last 10 years. Could have done without the brown-nosing, though, but I suspect it was at least partly sarcastic."
824,"I like how people call &quot;Actual Will FERRELL&quot; a bad sport because he&#39;s not laughing at these at best mildly funny news bloopers. I wouldn&#39;t laugh at these either, and not because I would be trying to win. This kid laughs at being in the atmosphere. I imagine him walking down the street giggling uncontrollably at every object, person, and event that he sees. This show is great at transmitting disease, I&#39;d reckon."
825,Will Ferrell thought this was a competition.  It was still funny though.
826,Funny as he&#39;ll
827,English just arent funny
828,"Wow, that Chris guy is a comedic lightweight. His reactions were far funnier than the audio clips, that&#39;s for sure!"
829,This video should have been called &quot;Will Ferrell Bukakes All Over A Young Boy&quot;.  Will what the fuck are you doing ??  Here I am trying to convince my family that you don&#39;t have a screw loose........ and now THIS !!  
830,MOM BRING THE MEATLOAFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!
831,omg Chris is so fuckin&#39; stupid. lmao it&#39;s like they have a 5 yearold on the show. I DIDN&#39;T EVEN LAUGH OR GRIND A SMILE AT ANY OF THEM. 
832,I&#39;m sorry I find this innuendo bingo game stupid challenge pretty dumb. 
833,With his mouth full of water Will Ferrell becomes Ron Perlman
834,"lol not a chance will was about to laugh, hes been working for years at improv comedy that deals with innuendos, guy rarely breaks character, even in front of other top class comedians "
835,"will ferrell does not find this stuff funny he is just spitting over him. yep, my initial assessment was right. he is a twat."
836,OMFG THIS IS SO FUNNY IM CREASING
837,da fak is this 
838,"Will Ferrell, the anti-craic. "
839,lol Chris looks so ashamed that he finds them funny
840,Its funny but when Will Ferrell has a mouth full of water he looks like Ron Perlman hahaha!!! :3
841,Chris: it&#39;s an honor yo be spat on by you.       <br>Will: yeah we&#39;ll I hope we can do it again<br>  xD
842,LMAO..Will is peeing on the dude.. poor dude
843,"the thing with Will Ferrell is he doesn&#39;t want to be made to laugh, he wants to make you laugh."
844,"Will didnt laugh due to the stuff wasn&#39;t funny, the situation was funnier than the game."
845,WILL FERRELL with his mouth full of water = Ron Perlman
846,"How do I get that jacket will is wearing, I need that jacket so bad I love adidas "
847,I see why he wasn&#39;t laughing none of these shitty bbc radio innuendo bingo games are boring as hell
848,It&#39;s an honor to be spat on by you. Hahaha
849,Holy Christopher🙈😆 
850,Chris Stark. Perfect guy !!
851,Ron Perlman
852,the reason will held up so well is because hes an actor he can hide his emotions easier
853,Haha It&#39;s an honor to be spat on by you!
854,is that the guy who was flirting with mila kunis?
855,Will made me laugh even though he&#39;s not in a movie!!!
856,So. Tumblr led me here. All the way from New Zealand. You guys are amazing
857,These english are to kind
858,This is why I love Will Ferrell.
859,Will is trying to spit in the face like u can see it cause he&#39;s not laughing
860,Omg please get robert sheehan he would be hilarious!!!! 
861,Wow will is a humourless dick IRL
862,OMG Will Ferrell&#39;s profile is a lama face with the mouth full of water
863,Will IS comedy
864,Will Ferrell looks like George W Bush with his mouth full of water
865,Clay Morrow?
866,"I knew he would be expressionless the whole time, solely cause I knew it would be funnier. And Will is a comedian. My favorite comedian at that. "
867,chris reminds me a lot of someone and i&#39;m thinking alfie days...?
868,Chris is the funny one
869,He&#39;s like salad fingers level fucked up yet in real life; the guy.<br><br>And Will Ferrel was so disinterested he just started shooting out the water to see the water jet.
870,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m11s"">7:11</a> hahaha XD"
871,this would&#39;ve been better if tim and eric edited it
872,"Will Ferrell was a pretty bad sport here, was kind of awkward"
873,I bet Triple H would be good at this.
874,Will looks like Ron Perlman with his cheeks full
875,wait does he spit it back into the bucket? 
876,"PISCES - The Partner for Life (February 19 to March 20) <br>Caring and kind. Smart. Likes to be the centre of attention. Very organized. High appeal to opposite sex. Likes to have the last word. Good to find, but hard to keep. Passionate, wonderful lovers. Fun to be around. Too trusting at times and gets hurt easily. VERY caring. They always try to do the right thing and sometimes get the short end of the stick. They sometimes get used by others and get hurt because of their trusting. Extremely weird but in a good way. Good sense of humour!!! Thoughtful. Loves to joke. Very popular. Silly, fun and sweet. Good friend to others but needs to be choosy on who they allow their friends to be. 5 years of bad luck if you do not forward."
877,Chris is so nervous 
878,it looks so awkward lol
879,Funniest I&#39;ve seen in a long time
880,"Why get a big star like Will Ferrell in, then have him sit mainly in silence with a mouth full of water. It&#39;s such a stupid game for the radio."
881,A lot of British people think Americans don&#39;t get our comedy. They get it. Who ON EARTH couldn&#39;t. Most of the time it just isn&#39;t funny. 
882,&quot;Will just went straight for the head there...&quot; Ummmmmmm okay. X&#39;D
883,Whenever I see will Ferrell I can&#39;t unseen elf
884,I honestly just had the best laughs I&#39;ve had in years. I had trouble breathing and was making some new kind of hissing sound haha.
885,"With will feral and water, he should be a fuckin Pokemon "
886,Haha it&#39;s an honour to b spat on by u x 
887,Chris was pathetic compared to Will
888,"well this was boring, the clips werent even funny"
889,Why the hell did Chris not just go for it?
890,Will spit on purpose<br>
891,Will with water in his mouth looks like Ron Perlman. Or is it just me?
892,i love how will was just fucking with him
893,these arnt even funny! only the youtuber innuendos are funny!
894,I like that Will Ferrell just gave up on the game and opted to just spray the guy in the face.
895,omg the best is that Will just seems bored so he&#39;s spraying Chris on purpose. 
896,"Man this radio show sucks, their bits are awful and poorly constructed."
897,The funniest thing about this is just how embarrassed and ashamed Chris looks.
898,normally the innuendos are better
899,The shame in Chris&#39;s face is as if he is a dog that just peed on the carpet
900,"I usually find Will Ferrell funny, but I thought he was being a bit of a dick in this."
901,Chris looks genuinely scared in this video...
902,"In fairness, who would laugh at audio clips of innuendo?"
903,Will has no soul :D
904,"LMAO, Chris xD"
905,its an honor to be spat on by you???? lol
906,Man he just looks like a dick in this
907,"oh man, funniest thing i&#39;ve seen in a long time :,D"
908,I thinks it&#39;s funnier that Will doesn&#39;t find them funny
909,its funny how he felt so bad about spitting on will after almost every clip
910,Will Ferrell with a mouth full of water looks an awful lot like Ron Pearlman.
911,this is one of the least funniest bingo ..
912,I died of laughter the minute I saw Will&#39;s face at the beggining. This man... Oh my God xD
913,"Lol i could see them trying not to giggle even at the start, all you have to do is picture him in an elf costume going &quot;I&#39;m hereee. with my dad and... he wants me to sing him a soooonng, but i&#39;m here now, i found you, daddy&quot; or the sarcastic part when pappa elf took him to the sleigh for the first time and they were saying how nobody thinks santa is real and that there&#39;s a rumor that the parents buy the presents lmao. Will is just purposely spraying it on him to make him laugh aha love him."
914,Wow! Best innuendo bingo ever!
915,Seeing Will Ferrell with a mouthful reminds me of the neanderthal people. 
916,"&#39;I promise you, the president has a big stick&#39;...Ferrell is made of stone"
917,"this is shite, I&#39;ll stay with mid morning matters."
918,"Not the best one, his lack of participation made it kinda dull. Best one is with the guy who plays Neville Longbottom, now THAT is a funny one "
919,"they&#39;ve done studies you know, 60% of the time, chris spits everytime ;)"
920,Worse done yet! Very disappointing! 
921,Chris was a bit star struck and shit out!! He should have spat it right in wills face!!
922,this as definitely been the funniest one so far :D
923,Oh my God I&#39;m dying at this. The fact he doesn&#39;t seem to get it or is bemused by it makes it&#39;s 20 times funnier.<br>Genuinely crying here.
924,I think they shouldn&#39;t play with big star such as will ferrell cos Chris and the viewers/listener don&#39;t even know what to expect from these people
925,Should have used some old classics to make him laugh. Clips were poor this time.
926,Should have used some old classics to make him laugh. Clips were poor this time.
927,i think its funny how chris looks at will every time and just says I&#39;m sorry as if he&#39;s done something wrong
928,It looks akward<br>
929,I like will.. but he just seems like a dick on this
930,Poor Chris! This whole thing looks so awkward.
931,it seriously wasn&#39;t funny?.... wtf lol
932,Will Ferrell looks like Ron Perlman when his mouth is full
933,Oh my GOD this is so WONDERFULLY awkward!!!
934,7:21 &quot;I&#39;m so sorry&quot; xD
935,"Am I the only person who never finds Will Ferrell funny, ever!? I love innuendo bingo but this was the least funny one. Will just ruins it"
936,British humor just isn&#39;t funny.
937,Will is always using these kinds of jokes in the films he does so he will be more immune to laughing after hearing them so much...
938,"Another tired Scott Mills segment, time to find some new gags!"
939,Will Ferrel + water = Ron Perlman
940,This really isn&#39;t that funny
941,With the water in his mouth Will Ferrell looks like Ron Pearlman.
942,Fill Werrell is a legend.
943,"I heard a great innuendo at a Charity Gig. The band took a break, then the drummer sang one of the songs, while the rest of the band had a rest. After the song, the drummer sat back down at the drumkit and says &quot;Ok folks.. It&#39;s Saturday night and I&#39;m BACK on the KIT! So let&#39;s get on with the night&quot; (This is hilarious innuendo to Scottish people of a certain age as &quot;Kit&quot; was what they called Heroin, back in the day."
944,poor Chris doesn&#39;t know what to do lol!Will just sat there 
945,"Will didn&#39;t let himself go he was just in Ron Burgandy mode, "
946,imagine if eminem played this
947,All I can think of is how warm that water must have been lol
948,Much better to watch this one than hear it. Will Ferrell was a good sport.
949,The sheer sight of Ferrell with a gob full is enough to crack me up.
950,"Imagine listening to this on the radio, without the visuals. It was awful. Dead air, unfunny and crap. "
951,Awww i fell so sorry for Chris xD  that is so awkward! 
952, So good!
953,scott is worried about it being cringy
954,Honestly don&#39;t know how anyone would laugh at this dumb shit. Will made it awesome by being the only fumny bit
955,Honestly don&#39;t know how anyone would laugh at this dumb shit. Will made it awesome by being the only fumny bit
956,Really. ... don&#39;t get how the brits are surprised. ... Will has worked on snl where a majority of the time it&#39;s required not to laugh or you f up the scene
957,Easily the funniest yet ;)
958,&quot;Actual WILL FERRELL came to BBC Radio 1 to play Innuendo Bingo with Chris Stark off of the Scott Mills Show.&quot; - OFF OF??? Who writes this shit!? OFF OF!
959,This was really disappointing... 
960,"Will Farrell is such a tool. Simple humour for simple minds, I guess."
961,Aww poor chris I feel so awkward for him x
962,LOL!!!!
963,American&#39;s just don&#39;t get our humour ahahah. 
964,Hahaha quality!!
965,I love Will Ferrel so much :&#39;D
966,British comedy always was the best
967,"Yep, Radio 1....delving down into the dregs of society again. R1 just gets more disgusting by the day..... Is this what we are teaching todays youngsters how to behave... is it any wonder we have the problematic society we have. R1 isn&#39;t the cause I know but it certainly is exacerbating the problem.."
968,How embarrassing. bet he was like WTF am i doing here!!  
969,"To everyone saying this wasn&#39;t funny, you must all be American. It had me in stitches the contrast between how will was just sitting there and Chris losing it, one of the best ones they have done "
970,Arrrgh. This was too slow.
971,awkward 
972,Radio 1 is my favorite radio
973,"Man, I  wish will ferrel would spit on me :("
974,Amazing 
975,Kkkk
976,Will Ferrel has no soul.
977,This is class
978,Well.... I hope Will wont be coming back for any more innuendo bingos
979,I love how Chris doubles-up as a water fountain. Some top class arcs were made with that water. ;)
980,Aww gutted. I&#39;ve been waiting for this video ever since they did it. What a let down. Definitely not as funny as I&#39;d imagined.
981,Misleading thumbnail. 
982,Will ferrell + gob full of water = ron pearlman
983,Well that was awkward..
984,Video was a bit funnier. Was awful on the radio. Bit of an anticlimax 
985,hope Gemma can get fit in soon I miss her 
986,Funny!
987,Trying to make a top comedian laugh with a crap show like this was always going to be a disappointment. Such a shame.
988,"I think that it&#39;s a great game and I laugh all the time. Chris is the one who makes me laugh the most. Plus Scott explained that Will Ferrell is very hard to get to laugh, so obviously Chris needed to pull the weight on it. But Chris&#39;s reaction to being starstruck was the best. He couldn&#39;t even hold it in. "
989,"Well, that was a hard watch. To be fair I&#39;m on Will&#39;s side on this one, the innuendos were all terrible apart from the last one. It&#39;s usually a lot better. You can see Scott Mills squirm as he realises that this segment is turning out to be shit."
990,Lol was Chris a little nervous 
991,he is a comedian so of course he can hold it but he is still a great sport about getting soaked :)
992,"I&#39;m American and I love Innuendo Bingo, but this was just painful to watch. How awkward. Poor Chris."
993,"that was pure 100% comedy, holy shit. tears down my eyes i was laughing so hard."
994,"Is Scott&#39;s face orange at first and massively red after. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cringe"">#cringe</a> "
995,"Well it would be too much like  someone having a simple laugh with someone else, heaven forbid that would be like G.W.B taking a dry fat banana up his arse in front of his wife!"
996,This is uncomfortable to watch - poor Chris!
997,"Will: it was funnier watching you<br>Chris: I&#39;m such a huge fan of yours, it is an honor to be spat on by you<br>Will: I hope we can do it again<br><br>LOL"
998,Well its not surprising seeing as Will Ferrell is a professional comedian and worked on SNL for years so he&#39;s pretty pretty good at not laughing at things
999,"I think its been known for a long long time that American and English humour clash a hell of a lot.  Saying that, that wasn&#39;t all that good tbh."
1000,Chris makes this hilarious 
1001,I think the lack of explosions is why Americans aren&#39;t finding this as funny as it is.
1002,This is genius comedy from Will
1003,Well... That was just shit
1004,the only time i&#39;ve ever seen Will Ferrel on the verge of laughing is with Billy Eichner lol
1005,Least funny thing I&#39;ve seen in 2013...
1006,Bits aren&#39;t funny
1007,"URGENT APPEAL PLEASE Help save my sisters sight, by reading her story here &gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=""https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/9f6Ba/ab/62Ovu7"">https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/9f6Ba/ab/62Ovu7</a> <br>PLEASE donate if possible THANK YOU!!!!!"
1008,Karl pillkinton 
1009,Would love to see Ricky gervais do this
1010,Crappest one yet
1011,This shows that Will ids a brilliant actor who knows what to do.
1012,everyone needs to bloody lighten up
1013,Such a bad ass:D
1014,<b>giggles</b> hehe x
1015,Ferrell is a pro. do your research radio 1
1016,"Hahahahaaha <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m12s"">7:12</a> "
1017,Haha chris &quot; I&#39;m so sorry&quot; like a little boy
1018,"Oh my god will Ferrell defo the best and worst contestant on this-ever. Mr. Ferrell, you are a legend"
1019," <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23britishhumour"">#britishhumour</a>   "
1020,Chris why do you look so funny at the start and why do you have a Hilary devey t-shirt
1021,"I think it&#39;s getting a bit old now, not that funny "
1022,"I think it&#39;s getting a bit old now, not that funny "
1023,Will Ferrell was sooooo jokes! Not even a flintch just weeing on Chris
1024,This show is nearly as bad as the breakfast show but Will Ferrell makes it worth a watch as even his facial expressions of disbelief are very funny.
1025,Will was such a let down. He could have played along with the game a bit better.....
1026,"<a href=""http://www.easyhits4u.com/customsplash/59101/"">http://www.easyhits4u.com/customsplash/59101/</a>"
1027,"AWFUL I COULDNT HELP BUT THINK WILL FERRAL WAS ABOVE HIM,  SPITTING IT IN HIS WAS WITH NO EMOTION, IT JUST MADE THINGS ARKWARD I PERSONALLY DONT FIND HIM FUNNY HES BORING!  "
1028,Will was such a dick
1029,Actual Will Ferrell.. hate that chat
1030,"Hey Will, I dipped my balls in your drink... <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=4m19s"">4:19</a>"
1031,"If they want to make Ferrell laugh, they should have had John Reilly opposite him - he&#39;s the only one that can make Ferrell corpse."
1032,"Well, that was... infantile."
1033,Chris looked so traumatised
1034,am i the only one who doesnt find will twattell funny?
1035,"I found this painfully hilarious. Watching at the end of a rough day&#39;s teaching and a good laugh&#39;s cheered me right up - love the show always, but this was particularly epic"
1036,will was way to dry(no pun intended)... he should have got into it more.
1037,will ferrel came across very arrogant
1038,Will!
1039,"In fairness I think being sat opposite Will with memories of his scenes going through my head would be enough to make me laugh, let alone the sheer genius of some of these innuendos!"
1040,WILL&#39;S JUST SPITTING IT ON CHRIS HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH
1041,"By far the best inuendo bingo ever, legend"
1042,"Poor Chris, this is just an awkward clip. "
1043,"Innuendo is pretty much the basis of English humour. Will was just being Will. Shame he didn&#39;t get in the spirit of it, But well done to Scott and Chris for not letting the feature die."
1044,last line = priceless
1045,"They forget Will is a comedy film actor and was an SNL cast member for years, he&#39;s basically a professional non-laugherer."
1046,This game would be far better after a few pints. 
1047,"QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE TO WATCH, I THINK WILL WAS BEING A BIT OF AN ARSE : 0 ("
1048,Will could have easily gone for the cheap shot by apologizing for Chris&#39; &quot;performance issues.&quot; Would have made a better innuendo than any of the clips played.
1049,I love Will Ferrell but Chris Stark was awesome -- how does he get those multiple pinhole leaks?!?!?
1050,Will ferrel to me is not that funny i enjoy his voice talents to kids movies but i dont find him thay funny as an actor. The guy that played nevile longbottom from harry potter is a bigger star to me the ferrell
1051,"See I found it funny for a few reasons, one Chris couldn&#39;t keep his shit together, 2 it got harder for Chris as Will just sprayed him for fun, and three it&#39;s nice to see that Will has has kept his hard work from SNL, because it&#39;s called Saturday Night Live not Saturday Night Lets get another shot"
1052,Will is an actor. It takes a lot to break an actor when told not to laugh
1053,"I agree with Will, watching poor Chris was far funnier than the audio clips."
1054,I don&#39;t know what to think about this
1055,"tbh the clips that they play are sometimes funny but they are never that funny that you spit water out, even if your american or not and dont get the humour. "
1056,this is the funniest one yet
1057,Worst innuendo bingo 
1058,Aww. I like how Chris won&#39;t look Will in the eye
1059,"I hdidnt even laugh either I guess honestly, Americans find different things funny than British people "
1060,"If will laughed every time he found something funny, his movies would be extremely hard to film and full of bloopers! "
1061,us Brits are so childish I found them all funny
1062,"Awww poor Chris. Chris&#39;s aim is normally impeccable but he didn&#39;t want to go for the face before Will at least got involved. And as Will was acting bizarre (to say the least) it just got more and more awkward. How can you not laugh at &#39;it&#39;s 8 o&#39;c*ck&#39;, come on!"
1063,Awkward cos will is an American &amp; getting our innuendo jokes is like Not jokes for us Brits lol.  Watching stark widdle over wills lap quite amusing lol.
1064,"The things said were way too childish to be funny...and yes, I&#39;m American. And before you say i&#39;m too boring or old to laugh at childish stuff, I&#39;m a teenage boy hahaha The most immature thing in the world"
1065,The clips weren&#39;t even funny... 
1066,Will Ferrell with checks full of water looks quite a lot like Harry from Harry and the Hendersons
1067,Shows how childish they are
1068,"I&#39;m nearly in tears at how petrified Chris is , this is hilarious "
1069,during the entire video all I could think was &#39;poor Chris&#39;..:D
1070,Will Ferrell is a fucking comedy actor. of course its going to be hard to get a laugh out of him.
1071,"The most over-hyped, anti-climactic bingo ever. Will was a massive disappointment. Is it that our humour just flies past him, or was he not laughing on purpose? <br><br>Either way, it made this video almost unwatchable. "
1072,Shittest ever bingo how can you not find the clips abit funny 
1073,That was so awkward xD Poor Chris
1074,RUBBISH!!!
1075,Legend
1076,So awkward.
1077,what a knob
1078,"Don&#39;t get me wrong, Will Ferrell is a legend in Anchorman - a terrific comedy actor, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m crazy about his off-screen personality. He has a stoney, cold, awkward personality that makes interviewing him unnecessarily difficult."
1079,Lol
1080,Hahah &#39;its an honour to be spat on by you&#39;
1081,Chris just looks so uncomfortable
1082,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23awkward"">#awkward</a>"
1083,"Poor Chris!! That was more mean than actually funny!! Spraying someone who can&#39;t help but crack...Meanie, Will ferrel!"
1084,sounded like a let-down on air today - but oh my!
1085,ferrell likes like pob
1086,Will Ferrell looks like a moose throughout this whole thing
1087,The president has a big stick
1088,He was looking like Ron pearlman<br>
1089,BEST EVER!
1090,"This is so embarrassing but so funny, oh my god..."
1091,"Pity WF had to be such a prick. If he doesn&#39;t say it, it&#39;s not allowed to be funny. Cringe."
1092,Hahaha :&#39;D
1093,Bit of a fail
1094,Us british are so immature
1095,BEST INNUENDO EVER!!!!
1096,Sorry that&#39;s the worst ib I&#39;ve seen in a while.
1097,Chris was obviously nervous sitting so close to Mr. Ferrell.  The funniest part of the entire thing was when Will said:  &quot;I hope we can do it again&quot;!  Well played guys! 
1098,Anchorman is so overrated and not funny.
1099,Love your jumper Chris.
1100,They were genuinely funny he was being a bit of a dick but the awkwardness made to the funniest one yet poor Chris 
1101,that was the most awkward game I&#39;ve ever watched he&#39;s too famous and too american to find this kind of thing funny.
1102,Will didn&#39;t find any funny he just wanted to get Chris
1103,"That looked so awkward,  his interview with Nick was poor too, that might be down to Grimshaws interviewing skills, but after seeing both, Ferrell seems like a bit of an arsehole."
1104,My favourite actor😂💕 all the comments about why he&#39;s not finding them funny are dumb he&#39;s a actor in comedy&#39;s he&#39;s heard all this before -.- 
1105,"Painful to watch, not funny at all, apologies to will. For being subjected to this "
1106,Quality!!!!! Best bingo ever.
1107,Such an amazing episode. Couldn&#39;t stop laughing at Chris. 
1108,Pretty sure this is the funniest innuendo bingo so far.
1109,Will is just an absolute LEGEND! 
1110,Will is just an absolute LEGEND! 
1111,Lol Will Ferrell just murdered this game.
1112,Ok so I&#39;m about half way through the video and so far Will hasn&#39;t even flinched. Getting slightly awkward now. Someone people tell me it gets better. 
1113,"Chris is just the best, that was actually adorable xD"
1114,Amazing
1115,What a let down Will Ferrell was - Expected some more humour from him! 
1116,Chris face at the start…..psml
1117,The BEST!
1118,Brilliant
1119,Best thing ever.
1120,will ferrell seemed like kinda a dick 
1121,That was the most incredible thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life! Crying tears from laughter and my gut hurts! Best innuendo bingo so far!
1122,"Man, Will is strong. Best poker face. I would not have survived."
1123,That was crap
1124,my side hurts
1125,will ferrell is too mature for us...obviously.
1126,I know there&#39;s a difference between American and British humour but some of them where so obvious that someone who travels the world for film promotion should learn a thing or two and have a good guess. Or he was doing the the straight face as an act or personal joke... can&#39;t tell.
1127,Sorry that was rubbish
1128,BUT WAIT THAT&#39;S ACTUALLY HIM OMG WOW
1129,I KNOW HIM
1130,Waste of flaming time...
1131,awkwardness made this slightly funnier than it actually was!...
1132,Will thought that was wank
1133,Will is about as funny as Anchor man was!
1134,the last innuendo should be played more!!!:O
1135,thank fuck for people like will ferrel everyone else who does this are so fake and just spit out the water for fun
1136,I laughed so hard at Chris&#39; face when he&#39;s holding the paper
1137,"OMG is that the real shitty watercolour?!? You&#39;re like a celebrity in your own right!<br><br>Side note: shame Ferrell didn&#39;t find the clips funny, but that man spits water out magnificently."
1138,Well done Chris x
1139,Will Ferrell just comes across like a right wank!!! He thinks he was being funny but just wasn&#39;t x
1140,This was so awkward lol
1141,"I didnt find any of those funny, american humor must be different"
1142,will looked completely unimpressed
1143,Can&#39;t stop watching the first 15 seconds!
1144,Wills fucking class
1145,Haha Chris&#39;s face is brilliant<br>
1146,Chris is just so cute!
1147,"I think Will was trying to be funny? Not sure, he just came off as a total dick to me.. I don&#39;t think he was even paying attention to what the audio was saying.."
1148,chris!
1149,I felt sorry for Chris and I don&#39;t get why Will wasn&#39;t laughing!
1150,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a> is it me or is chris stark treating will ferell with the way hes apologizing. Best innuendo bingo even though will ferell didnt understand the rules."
1151,I&#39;m a bit confused. Is this a case of how different the British and American sense of humour is or did Will actually find them funny and was just making it awkward for Chris?
1152,Well done radio 1you made will Ferrell unhappy twice in like a week? <br><br>How does someone even manage that?
1153,lol
1154,"Dissapointing, he is to American to even get the jokes. It&#39;s no fun if only Chris spit&#39;s out the water laughing"
1155,It was funny all the same but he seems like a bit of a dick
1156,best bit was watching how awkward chris is throughout the whole thing! of course will&#39;s a pro at keeping a straight face - thats his job!
1157,"Well that was a let down, thanks for nothing Will!"
1158,Thought Will was being a dick for spitting on him like that but<br>1. it was too funny and<br>2. I guess that how you play the game
1159,Hw does he not laugh
1160,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyNJD8Ewcjk&amp;t=0m14s"">0:14</a> LOL!!!"
1161,HAHAHAHA lol Will Farrell Puts this intern to shame so much that the intern is asking for forgiveness now thats pathetic and amusing at the same time
1162,wasnt funny
1163,wasnt funny
1164,&quot;It&#39;s an honour to be spat on by you&quot; 
1165,"This is hilarious!  Will Ferrell was right, the best bit was watching Chris in this!"
1166,Hahaha gotta love Will. Legend.
1167,Damn!!
1168,This was dissapointing :[
1169,yay

2473,i know what they were thinking..i know
2474,I&#39;m actually more impressed the guy behind the camera understood what Ethan was saying... 😐
2475,I played along it was fun
2476,"There is this guy in Vegas who has a hypnotist act where he takes 10 people twice a day (just the weekends I think has been a while) and he hypnotizes them for the audience&#39;s amusement. When interviewed he was asked common questions like &quot;Is it real?&quot; or &quot;how hard is it to hypnotize someone&quot; and &quot;how do you find that many people you can put under each night.&quot; Well he says that it is real <b>BUT</b> he doesn&#39;t think that everyone on stage (who were prepped in the back cause you know....don&#39;t want to hypno someone in the audience by mistake) is not under his influence every time. What he believes is that most do fall under hypnosis but then you have those willing to play along, even like the idea that they are part of something and might ham it up a bit.<br>  I guess what I&#39;m saying is that some of these people on here are under the influence of the stage/camera. They are hamming it up a little too much for their own reasons, maybe not all but more than 90% cannot be blowing their loads like that over these videos."
